mythical events. — The data essential to chronological determination
are here wanting. — Modern chronologists take up the same problem
as ancient, but with a different canon of belief. — Mr. Clinton’s
opinion on the computations of the date of the Trojan war. — Value
of the chronological computations depends on the trustworthiness
of the genealogies. — Mr. Clinton’s vindication of the genealogies
— his proofs. — 1. Inscriptions — none of proved antiquity. —
Genealogies — numerous, and of unascertainable date. — 2. Early
poets. — Mr. Clinton’s separation of the genealogical persons into
real and fabulous: principles on which it is founded. — Remarks on
his opinion. — His concessions are partial and inconsistent, yet
sufficient to render the genealogies inapplicable for chronology.
— Mr. Clinton’s positions respecting <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_v">[p. v]</span>historical evidence. — To what extent
presumption may stand in favor of the early poets. — Plausible
fiction satisfies the conditions laid down by Mr. Clinton — not
distinguishable from truth without the aid of evidence. — Kadmus,
Danaus, Hyllus, etc., all eponyms, and falling under Mr. Clinton’s
definition of fictitious persons. — What is real in the genealogies
cannot be distinguished from what is fictitious. — At what time did
the poets begin to produce continuous genealogies, from the mythical
to the real world? — Evidence of mental progress when men methodize
the past, even on fictitious principles.</p>

<p class="chap">CHAPTER XX.</p>

<p class="subchap">STATE OF SOCIETY AND MANNERS AS EXHIBITED IN
GRECIAN LEGEND.</p>

<p class="mt1">Legendary poems of Greece valuable pictures of real
manners, though giving no historical facts. — They are memorials
of the first state of Grecian society — the starting-point of
Grecian history. — Comparison of legendary with historical Greece —
government of the latter — of the former. — The king — in legendary
Greece. — His overruling personal ascendency. — Difficulty which
Aristotle found in explaining to himself the voluntary obedience
paid to the early kings. — The boulê — the agora: their limited
intervention and subordination to the king. — The agora — a medium
for promulgation of the intentions of the king. — Agora summoned
by Telemachus in Ithaka. — Agora in the second book of the Iliad —
picture of submission which it presents. — Conduct of Odysseus to
the people and the chiefs. — Justice administered in the agora by
the king or chiefs. — Complaints made by Hesiod of unjust judgment
in his own case. — The king among men is analogous to Zeus among
gods. — The Council and Assembly, originally media through which the
king acted, become, in historical Greece, the paramount depositaries
of power. — Spartan kings an exception to the general rule — their
limited powers. — Employment of public speaking as an engine of
government — coeval with the earliest times. — Its effects in
stimulating intellectual development. — Moral and social feeling
in legendary Greece. — Omnipotence of personal feeling towards the
gods, the king, or individuals. — Effect of special ceremonies. —
Contrast with the feelings in historical Athens. — Force of the
family tie. — Marriage — respect paid to the wife. — Brothers,
and kinsmen. — Hospitality. — Reception of the stranger and the
suppliant. — Personal sympathies the earliest form of sociality.
— Ferocious and aggressive passions unrestrained. — Picture given
by Hesiod still darker. — Contrast between heroic and historical
Greece. — Orphans. — Mutilation of dead bodies. — Mode of dealing
with homicide. — Appeased by valuable compensation (ποινὴ) to the
kinsman of the murdered man. — Punished in historical Greece as a
crime against society. — Condition, occupations, and professions
of the Homeric Greeks. — Slaves. — Thêtes. — Limited commerce and
navigation of the Homeric Greeks. — Kretans, Taphians, Phœnicians. —
Nature of Phœnician trade as indicated by Homer. — Weapons and mode
of fighting of the Homeric Greeks. — Contrast with the military array
of historical Greece. — Analogous change — in military array and in
civil society. — Fortification of towns. — Earliest residences of the
Greeks — hill-villages lofty and difficult <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_vi">[p. vi]</span>of access. — Homeric society recognizes
walled towns, individual property, and strong local attachments. —
Means of defence superior to those of attack. — Habitual piracy. —
Extended geographical knowledge in the Hesiodic poems, as compared
with Homer. — Astronomy and physics. — Coined money, writing, arts.
— Epic poetry. — Its great and permanent influence on the Greek
mind.</p>

<p class="chap">CHAPTER XXI.</p>

<p class="subchap">GRECIAN EPIC. HOMERIC POEMS.</p>

<p class="mt1">Two classes of epic poetry — Homeric — Hesiodic. —
Didactic and mystic Hexameter poetry — later as a genus than the
epic. — Lost epic poems. — Epic poets and their probable dates. —
Epic cycle. — What the epic cycle was — an arrangement of the poems
according to continuity of narrative. — Relation of the epic cycle
to Homer. — What poems were included in the cycle. — The Iliad and
Odyssey are the only poems of the cycle preserved. — Curiosity which
these two poems provoke — no data to satisfy it. — Different poems
ascribed to Homer. — Nothing known, and endless diversity of opinion,
respecting the person and date of Homer. — Poetical gens of the
Homêrids. — Homer, the superhuman eponymus and father of this gens.
— What may be the dates of the Iliad and Odyssey. — Date assigned
by Herodotus the most probable. — Probable date of the Iliad and
Odyssey between 850 and 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> — Epic
poems recited to assembled companies, not read by individuals apart.
— Lyric and choric poetry, intended for the ear. — Importance of the
class of rhapsodes, singers, and reciters. — Rhapsodes condemned by
the Socratic philosophers — undeservedly. — Variations in the mode of
reciting the ancient epic. — At what time the Homeric poems began to
be written. — Prolegomena of Wolf — raised new questions respecting
the Homeric text — connected unity of authorship with poems written
from the beginning. — The two questions not necessarily connected,
though commonly discussed together. — Few traces of writing, long
after the Homeric age. — Bards or rhapsodes of adequate memory,
less inconsistent with the conditions of the age than long MSS. —
Blind bards. — Possibility of preserving the poems by memory, as
accurately as in fact they were preserved. — Argument from the lost
letter Digamma. — When did the Homeric poems begin to be written?
— Reasons for presuming that they were first written about the
middle of the seventh century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> —
Condition of the Iliad and Odyssey down to the reign of Peisistratus.
— Theory of Wolf. — Authorities quoted in its favor. — Objections
against it. — Other long epic poems besides the Iliad and Odyssey.
— Catalogue in the Iliad — essentially a part of a long poem — its
early authority. — Iliad and Odyssey were entire poems long anterior
to Peisistratus, whether they were originally composed as entire or
not. — No traces in the Homeric poems, of ideas or customs belonging
to the age of Peisistratus. — Homeric poems. 1. Whether by one
author or several. 2. Whether of one date and scheme. — Question
raised by Wolf — Sagen-poesie. — New standard applied to the Homeric
poems. — Homeric unity — generally rejected by German critics in the
last generation — now again partially revived. — Scanty evidence —
difficulty of forming any conclusive opinion. — Method of studying
the question of Homeric unity. — Odyssey to be <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_vii">[p. vii]</span>studied first, as of more simple and
intelligible structure than the Iliad — Odyssey — evidences of
one design throughout its structure. — Exhibits very few marks of
incoherence or contradiction. — Chronological reckoning in the
Odyssey, inaccurate in one case. — Inference erroneously drawn from
hence, that the parts of the poem were originally separate. — Double
start and double stream of events, ultimately brought into confluence
in the Odyssey. — Skill displayed in this point by the poet. —
Difficulty of imagining the Odyssey broken up into many existing
poems or songs. — Structure of the Odyssey — essentially one — cannot
have been pieced together out of preëxisting epics. — Analogy of the
Odyssey shows that long and premeditated epical composition consists
with the capacities of the early Greek mind. — Iliad — much less
coherent and uniform than the Odyssey. — Incoherence prevails only
in parts of the poem — manifest coherence in other parts. — Wolfian
theory explains the former, but not the latter. — Theory of Welcker,
Lange, and Nitzsch. — Age of the Epos preparatory to that of the
Epopee. — Iliad essentially an organized poem — but the original
scheme does not comprehend the whole poem. — Iliad — originally an
Achillêis built upon a narrower plan, then enlarged. — Parts which
constitute the primitive Achillêis exhibit a coherent sequence of
events. — Disablement of Agamemnôn, Odysseus, and Diomêdês, all
in the battle of the eleventh book. — The first book concentrates
attention upon Achilles, and upon the distress which the Greeks are
to incur in consequence of the injury done to him. — Nothing done to
realize this expectation until the eighth book. — Primitive Achillêis
includes books i, viii, xi to xxii. — Ninth book an unsuitable
addition. — Transition from the Achillêis into the Iliad, in the
beginning of the second book. — Transition from the Iliad back into
the Achillêis at the end of the seventh book. — Fortification of the
Grecian camp. — Zeus in the fourth book, or Iliad, different from
Zeus in the first and eighth, or Achillêis. — Continuous Achillêis —
from the eleventh book onward. — Supposition of an enlarged Achillêis
is the most consonant to all the parts of the poem as it stands. —
Question of one or many authors — difficult to decide. — Odyssey
all by one author, Iliad probably not. — Difference of style in the
last six books — may be explained without supposing difference of
authorship. — Last two books — probably not parts of the original
Achillêis. — Books ii. to vii. inclusive. — Book x. — Odyssey —
probably by a different author from the Iliad — but perhaps of
the same age. — Real character of the Homeric poems — essentially
popular. — Addressed to unlettered minds, but touching those feelings
which all men have in common. — No didactic purpose in Homer.</p>

Lykurgus is the trainer of a military brotherhood, more than the

— much romance in them. — New partition of lands — no such measure

  <h3>SECTION I.—RETURN OF THE HERAKLEIDS INTO PELOPONNESUS.</h3>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">In one</span> of the preceding
chapters, we have traced the descending series of the two most
distinguished mythical families in Peloponnêsus,—the Perseids and the
Pelopids: we have followed the former down to Hêraklês and his son
Hyllus, and the latter down to Orestês son of Agamemnôn, who is left
in possession of that ascendancy in the peninsula which had procured
for his father the chief command in the Trojan war. The Herakleids,
or sons of Hêraklês, on the other hand, are expelled fugitives,
dependent upon foreign aid or protection: Hyllus had perished in
single combat with Echemus of Tegea, (connected with the Pelopids
by marriage with Timandra sister of Klytæmnêstra,<a id="FNanchor_1"
href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>) and a solemn compact
had been made, as the preliminary condition of this duel, that no
similar attempt at an invasion of the peninsula should be undertaken
by his family for the space of one hundred years. At the end of the
stipulated period the attempt was renewed, and with complete success;
but its success was owing, not so much to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span> the valor of the invaders as to a powerful
body of new allies. The Herakleids reappear as leaders and companions
of the Dorians,—a northerly section of the Greek name, who now first
come into importance,—poor, indeed, in mythical renown, since they
are never noticed in the Iliad, and only once casually mentioned in
the Odyssey, as a fraction among the many-tongued inhabitants of
Krête,—but destined to form one of the grand and predominant elements
throughout all the career of historical Hellas.</p>

<p>The son of Hyllus—Kleodæus—as well as his grandson Aristomachus,
were now dead, and the lineage of Hêraklês was represented by the
three sons of the latter,—Têmenus, Kresphontês, and Aristodêmus,
and under their conduct the Dorians penetrated into the peninsula.
The mythical account traced back this intimate union between the
Herakleids and the Dorians to a prior war, in which Hêraklês himself
had rendered inestimable aid to the Dorian king Ægimius, when the
latter was hard pressed in a contest with the Lapithæ. Hêraklês
defeated the Lapithæ, and slew their king Korônus; in return for
which Ægimius assigned to his deliverer one third part of his whole
territory, and adopted Hyllus as his son. Hêraklês desired that
the territory thus made over might be held in reserve until a time
should come when his descendants might stand in need of it; and
that time did come, after the death of Hyllus, (see Chap. V.) Some
of the Herakleids then found shelter at Trikorythus in Attica, but
the remainder, turning their steps towards Ægimius, solicited from
him the allotment of land which had been promised to their valiant
progenitor. Ægimius received them according to his engagement, and
assigned to them the stipulated third portion of his territory:<a
id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and
from this moment the Herakleids and Dorians<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span> became intimately united together into one
social communion. Pamphylus and Dymas, sons of Ægimius, accompanied
Têmenus and his two brothers in their invasion of Peloponnêsus.</p>

<p>Such is the mythical incident which professes to explain the
origin of those three tribes into which all the Dorian communities
were usually divided,—the Hyllêis, the Pamphyli, and the Dymanes,—the
first of the three including certain particular families, such as
that of the kings of Sparta, who bore the special name of Herakleids.
Hyllus, Pamphylus, and Dymas are the eponymous heroes of the three
Dorian tribes.</p>

<p>Têmenus and his two brothers resolved to attack Peloponnêsus, not
by a land-march along the Isthmus, such as that in which Hyllus had
been previously slain, but by sea, across the narrow inlet between
the promontories of Rhium and Antirrhium, with which the Gulf of
Corinth commences. According to one story, indeed,—which, however,
does not seem to have been known to Herodotus,—they are said to
have selected this line of march by the express direction of the
Delphian god, who vouchsafed to expound to them an oracle which had
been delivered to Hyllus in the ordinary equivocal phraseology. Both
the Ozolian Lokrians, and the Ætolians, inhabitants of the northern
coast of the Gulf of Corinth, were favorable to the enterprise,
and the former granted to them a port for building their ships,
from which memorable circumstance the port ever afterwards bore the
name of Naupaktus. Aristodêmus was here struck with lightning and
died, leaving twin sons, Eurysthenês and Proklês; but his remaining
brothers continued to press the expedition with alacrity.</p>

<p>At this juncture, an Akarnanian prophet named Karnus presented
himself in the camp<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> under the inspiration of Apollo, and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span> uttered various
predictions: he was, however, so much suspected of treacherous
collusion with the Peloponnesians, that Hippotês, great-grandson
of Hêraklês through Phylas and Antiochus, slew him. His death drew
upon the army the wrath of Apollo, who destroyed their vessels and
punished them with famine. Têmenus, in his distress, again applying
to the Delphian god for succor and counsel, was made acquainted
with the cause of so much suffering, and was directed to banish
Hippotês for ten years, to offer expiatory sacrifice for the death
of Karnus, and to seek as the guide of the army a man with three
eyes.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
On coming back to Naupaktus, he met the Ætolian Oxylus, son of
Andræmôn, returning to his country, after a temporary exile in
Elis, incurred for homicide: Oxylus had lost one eye, but as he was
seated on a horse, the man and the horse together made up the three
eyes required, and he was adopted as the guide prescribed by the
oracle.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Conducted by him, they refitted their ships, landed on the opposite
coast of Achaia, and marched to attack Tisamenus son of Orestês,
then the great potentate of the peninsula. A decisive battle was
fought, in which the latter was vanquished and slain, and in which
Pamphylus and Dymas also perished. This battle made the Dorians
so completely masters of the Peloponnêsus, that they proceeded to
distribute the territory among themselves. The fertile land of
Elis had been by previous stipulation reserved for Oxylus, as a
recompense for his services as conductor: and it was agreed that
the three Herakleids,—Têmenus, Kresphontês, and the infant sons of
Aristodêmus,—should draw lots for Argos, Sparta, and Messênê. Argos
fell to Têmenus, Sparta to the sons of Aristodêmus, and Messênê to
Kresphontês; the latter having secured for himself this prize, the
most fertile territory of the three, by the fraud of putting into
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span> vessel out of
which the lots were drawn, a lump of clay instead of a stone, whereby
the lots of his brothers were drawn out while his own remained
inside. Solemn sacrifices were offered by each upon this partition:
but as they proceeded to the ceremony, a miraculous sign was seen
upon the altar of each of the brothers,—a toad corresponding to
Argos, a serpent to Sparta, and a fox to Messênê. The prophets,
on being consulted, delivered the import of these mysterious
indications: the toad, as an animal slow and stationary, was an
evidence that the possessor of Argos would not succeed in enterprises
beyond the limits of his own city; the serpent denoted the aggressive
and formidable future reserved to Sparta; the fox prognosticated a
career of wile and deceit to the Messenian.</p>

<p>Such is the brief account given by Apollodôrus of the Return of
the Herakleids, at which point we pass, as if touched by the wand of
a magician, from mythical to historical Greece. The story bears on
the face of it the stamp, not of history, but of legend,—abridged
from one or more of the genealogical poets,<a id="FNanchor_6"
href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and presenting such an
account as they thought satisfactory, of the first formation of
the great Dorian establishments in Peloponnêsus, as well as of the
semi-Ætolian Elis. Its incidents are so conceived as to have an
explanatory bearing on Dorian institutions,—upon the triple division
of tribes, characteristic of the Dorians,—upon the origin of the
great festival of the Karneia at Sparta, alleged to be celebrated
in expiation of the murder of Karnus,—upon the different temper
and character of the Dorian states among themselves,—upon the
early alliance of the Dorians with Elis, which contributed to give
ascendency and vogue to the Olympic games,—upon the reverential
dependence of Dorians towards the Delphian oracle,—and, lastly, upon
the etymology of the name Naupaktus. If we possessed the narrative
more in detail, we should probably find many more examples of
color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span>ing of the
legendary past suitable to the circumstances of the historical
present.</p>

<p>Above all, this legend makes out in favor of the Dorians and
their kings a mythical title to their Peloponnesian establishments;
Argos, Sparta, and Messênê are presented as rightfully belonging, and
restored by just retribution, to the children of Hêraklês. It was
to them that Zeus had specially given the territory of Sparta; the
Dorians came in as their subjects and auxiliaries.<a id="FNanchor_7"
href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Plato gives a very
different version of the legend, but we find that he, too, turns the
story in such a manner as to embody a claim of right on the part of
the conquerors. According to him, the Achæans, who returned from the
capture of Troy, found among their fellow-citizens at home—the race
which had grown up during their absence—an aversion to readmit them:
after a fruitless endeavor to make good their rights, they were at
last expelled, but not without much contest and bloodshed. A leader
named Dorieus, collected all these exiles into one body, and from him
they received the name of Dorians instead of Achæans; then marching
back, under the conduct of the Herakleids into Peloponnêsus, they
recovered by force the possessions from which they had been shut out,
and constituted the three Dorian establishments under the separate
Herakleid brothers, at Argos, Sparta, and Messênê. These three
fraternal dynasties were founded upon a scheme of intimate union and
sworn alliance one with the other, for the purpose of resisting any
attack which might be made upon them from Asia,<a id="FNanchor_8"
href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> either by the remaining
Trojans or by their allies. Such is the story as Plato believed
it; materially different in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p.
7]</span> the incidents related, yet analogous in mythical feeling,
and embodying alike the idea of a rightful reconquest. Moreover, the
two accounts agree in representing both the entire conquest and the
triple division of Dorian Peloponnêsus as begun and completed in
one and the same enterprise,—so as to constitute one single event,
which Plato would probably have called the Return of the Achæans, but
which was commonly known as the Return of the Herakleids. Though this
is both inadmissible and inconsistent with other statements which
approach close to the historical times, yet it bears every mark of
being the primitive view originally presented by the genealogical
poets: the broad way in which the incidents are grouped together, was
at once easy for the imagination to follow, and impressive to the
feelings.</p>

<p>The existence of one legendary account must never be understood
as excluding the probability of other accounts, current at the
same time, but inconsistent with it: and many such there were as
to the first establishment of the Peloponnesian Dorians. In the
narrative which I have given from Apollodôrus, conceived apparently
under the influence of Dorian feelings, Tisamenus is stated to have
been slain in the invasion. But according to another narrative,
which seems to have found favor with the historical Achæans on
the north coast of Peloponnêsus, Tisamenus, though expelled by
the invaders from his kingdom of Sparta or Argos, was not slain:
he was allowed to retire under agreement, together with a certain
portion of his subjects, and he directed his steps towards the
coast of Peloponnêsus south of the Corinthian Gulf, then occupied
by the Ionians. As there were relations, not only of friendship,
but of kindred origin, between Ionians and Achæans, (the eponymous
heroes Iôn and Achæus pass for brothers, both sons of Xuthus),
Tisamenus solicited from the Ionians admission for himself and his
fellow-fugitives into their territory. The leading Ionians declining
this request, under the apprehension that Tisamenus might be chosen
as sovereign over the whole, the latter accomplished his object by
force. After a vehement struggle, the Ionians were vanquished and
put to flight, and Tisamenus thus acquired possession of Helikê,
as well as of the northern coast of the peninsula, westward from
Sikyôn; which coast continued to be occupied by the Achæans,
and received its name from them, throughout all the historical
times.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span> The Ionians
retired to Attica, many of them taking part in what is called the
Ionic emigration to the coast of Asia Minor, which followed shortly
after. Pausanias, indeed, tells us that Tisamenus, having gained
a decisive victory over the Ionians, fell in the engagement,<a
id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and did
not himself live to occupy the country of which his troops remained
masters. But this story of the death of Tisamenus seems to arise
from a desire, on the part of Pausanias, to blend together into one
narrative two discrepant legends; at least the historical Achæans in
later times continued to regard Tisamenus himself as having lived
and reigned in their territory, and as having left a regal dynasty
which lasted down to Ogygês,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> after whom it was exchanged for a
popular government.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11"
class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The conquest of Têmenus, the eldest of the three Herakleids,
originally comprehended only Argos and its neighborhood; it was
from thence that Trœzen, Epidaurus, Ægina, Sikyôn, and Phlius
were successfully occupied by Dorians, the sons and son-in-law of
Têmenus—Deiphontês, Phalkês, and Keisus—being the leaders under
whom this was accomplished.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a> At Sparta, the success of the Dorians was
furthered by the treason of a man named Philonomus, who received
as recompense the neighboring town and territory of Amyklæ.<a
id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Messênia is said to have submitted without resistance to the dominion
of the Herakleid Kresphontês, who established his residence at
Stenyklêrus: the Pylian Melanthus, then ruler of the country, and
representative of the great mythical lineage of Nêleus and Nestôr,
withdrew with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span> his
household gods and with a portion of his subjects to Attica.<a
id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The only Dorian establishment in the peninsula not directly
connected with the triple partition is Corinth, which is said to
have been Dorized somewhat later and under another leader, though
still a Herakleid. Hippotês—descendant of Hêraklês in the fourth
generation, but not through Hyllus,—had been guilty (as already
mentioned) of the murder of Karnus the prophet at the camp of
Naupaktus, for which he had been banished and remained in exile
for ten years; his son deriving the name of Alêtês from the long
wanderings endured by the father. At the head of a body of Dorians,
Alêtês attacked Corinth: he pitched his camp on the Solygeian
eminence near the city, and harassed the inhabitants with constant
warfare until he compelled them to surrender. Even in the time of the
Peloponnesian war, the Corinthians professed to identify the hill
on which the camp of these assailants had been placed. The great
mythical dynasty of the Sisyphids was expelled, and Alêtês became
ruler and Œkist of the Dorian city; many of the inhabitants, however,
Æolic or Ionic, departed.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15"
class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The settlement of Oxylus and his Ætolians in Elis is said
by some to have been accomplished with very little opposition;
the leader professing himself to be descended from Ætolus, who
had been in a previous age banished from Elis into Ætôlia, and
the two people, Epeians and Ætolians, acknowledging a kindred
origin one with the other.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16"
class="fnanchor">[16]</a> At first, indeed, according to Ephorus,
the Epeians appeared in arms, determined to repel the intruders, but
at length it was agreed on both sides to abide the issue of a single
combat. Degmenus, the champion of the Epeians, confided in the long
shot of his bow and arrow; but the Ætolian Pyræchmês came provided
with his sling,—a weapon then unknown and recently invented by the
Ætolians,—the range of which was yet longer than that of the bow of
his enemy: he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span> thus
killed Degmenus, and secured the victory to Oxylus and his followers.
According to one statement, the Epeians were expelled; according to
another, they fraternized amicably with the new-comers: whatever
may be the truth as to this matter, it is certain that their name
is from this moment lost, and that they never reappear among the
historical elements of Greece:<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> we hear from this time forward only
of Eleians, said to be of Ætolian descent.<a id="FNanchor_18"
href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>One most important privilege was connected with the possession
of the Eleian territory by Oxylus, coupled with his claim on
the gratitude of the Dorian kings. The Eleians acquired the
administration of the temple at Olympia, which the Achæans are said
to have possessed before them; and in consideration of this sacred
function, which subsequently ripened into the celebration of the
great Olympic games, their territory was solemnly pronounced to be
inviolable. Such was the statement of Ephorus:<a id="FNanchor_19"
href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> we find, in this case
as in so many others, that the Return of the Herakleids is made
to supply a legendary basis for the historical state of things in
Peloponnêsus.</p>

<p>It was the practice of the great Attic tragedians, with rare
exceptions, to select the subjects of their composition from
the heroic or legendary world, and Euripidês had composed three
dramas, now lost, on the adventures of Têmenus with his daughter
Hyrnethô and his son-in-law Dêiphontês,—on the family misfortunes
of Kresphontês and Meropê,—and on the successful valor of Archelaus
the son of Têmenus in Macedonia, where he was alleged to have first
begun the dynasty of the Temenid kings. Of these subjects the
first and second were eminently tragical, and the third, relating
to Archelaus, appears to have been undertaken by Euripidês in
compliment to his contemporary sovereign and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span> patron, Archelaus king of Macedonia: we
are even told that those exploits which the usual version of the
legend ascribed to Têmenus, were reported in the drama of Euripidês
to have been performed by Archelaus his son.<a id="FNanchor_20"
href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Of all the heroes,
touched upon by the three Attic tragedians, these Dorian Herakleids
stand lowest in the descending genealogical series,—one mark amongst
others that we are approaching the ground of genuine history.</p>

<p>Though the name Achæans, as denoting a people, is henceforward
confined to the North-Peloponnesian territory specially called
Achaia, and to the inhabitants of Achæa, Phthiôtis, north of Mount
Œta,—and though the great Peloponnesian states always seem to have
prided themselves on the title of Dorians,—yet we find the kings
of Sparta, even in the historical age, taking pains to appropriate
to themselves the mythical glories of the Achæans, and to set
themselves forth as the representatives of Agamemnôn and Orestês.
The Spartan king Kleomenês even went so far as to disavow formally
any Dorian parentage; for when the priestess at Athens refused to
permit him to sacrifice in the temple of Athênê, on the plea that
it was peremptorily closed to all Dorians, he replied: “I am no
Dorian, but an Achæan.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21"
class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Not only did the Spartan envoy, before
Gelôn of Syracuse, connect the indefeasible title of his country
to the supreme command of the Grecian military force, with the
ancient name and lofty prerogatives of Agamemnôn,<a id="FNanchor_22"
href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>—but, in farther
pursuance of the same feeling, the Spartans are said to have
carried to Sparta both the bones of Orestês from Tegea, and those
of Tisamenus from Helikê,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> at the injunction of the Delphian oracle.
There is also a story that Oxylus in Elis was directed by the same
oracle to invite into his country an Achæan, as Œkist conjointly with
him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span>self; and that
he called in Agorius, the great-grandson of Orestês, from Helikê,
with a small number of Achæans who joined him.<a id="FNanchor_24"
href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The Dorians themselves,
being singularly poor in native legends, endeavored, not unnaturally,
to decorate themselves with those legendary ornaments which the
Achæans possessed in abundance.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the Dorian establishments in Peloponnêsus,
several migrations of the preëxisting inhabitants are represented as
taking place. 1. The Epeians of Elis are either expelled, or merged
in the new-comers under Oxylus, and lose their separate name. 2.
The Pylians, together with the great heroic family of Nêleus and
his son Nestôr, who preside over them, give place to the Dorian
establishment of Messênia, and retire to Athens, where their leader,
Melanthus, becomes king: a large portion of them take part in the
subsequent Ionic emigration. 3. A portion of the Achæans, under
Penthilus and other descendants of Orestês, leave Peloponnêsus, and
form what is called the Æolic emigration, to Lesbos, the Trôad,
and the Gulf of Adramyttium: the name <i>Æolians</i>, unknown to Homer,
and seemingly never applied to any separate tribe at all, being
introduced to designate a large section of the Hellenic name, partly
in Greece Proper, and partly in Asia. 4. Another portion of Achæans
expel the Ionians from Achaia, properly so called, in the north of
Peloponnêsus; the Ionians retiring to Attica.</p>

<p>The Homeric poems describe Achæans, Pylians, and Epeians, in
Peloponnêsus, but take no notice of Ionians in the northern district
of Achaia: on the contrary, the Catalogue in the Iliad distinctly
includes this territory under the dominions of Agamemnôn. Though the
Catalogue of Homer is not to be regarded as an historical document,
fit to be called as evidence for the actual state of Peloponnêsus
at any prior time, it certainly seems a better authority than the
statements advanced by Herodotus and others respecting the occupation
of northern Peloponnêsus by the Ionians, and their expulsion from
it by Tisamenus. In so far as the Catalogue is to be trusted, it
negatives the idea of Ionians at Helikê, and countenances what seems
in itself a more natural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p.
13]</span> supposition,—that the historical Achæans in the north
part of Peloponnêsus are a small undisturbed remnant of the powerful
Achæan population once distributed throughout the peninsula, until it
was broken up and partially expelled by the Dorians.</p>

<p>The Homeric legends, unquestionably the oldest which we possess,
are adapted to a population of Achæans, Danaans, and Argeians,
seemingly without any special and recognized names, either aggregate
or divisional, other than the name of each separate tribe or kingdom.
The post-Homeric legends are adapted to a population classified
quite differently,—Hellens, distributed into Dorians, Ionians, and
Æolians. If we knew more of the time and circumstances in which these
different legends grew up, we should probably be able to explain
their discrepancy; but in our present ignorance we can only note the
fact.</p>

<p>Whatever difficulty modern criticism may find in regard to the
event called “The Return of the Herakleids,” no doubt is expressed
about it even by the best historians of antiquity. Thucydidês accepts
it as a single and literal event, having its assignable date, and
carrying at one blow the acquisition of Peloponnêsus. The date of
it he fixes as eighty years after the capture of Troy. Whether he
was the original determiner of this epoch, or copied it from some
previous author, we do not know. It must have been fixed according
to some computation of generations, for there were no other means
accessible,—probably by means of the lineage of the Herakleids,
which, as belonging to the kings of Sparta, constituted the most
public and conspicuous thread of connection between the Grecian real
and mythical world, and measured the interval between the Siege
of Troy itself and the first recorded Olympiad. Hêraklês himself
represents the generation before the siege, and his son Tlepolemus
fights in the besieging army. If we suppose the first generation
after Hêraklês to commence with the beginning of the siege, the
fourth generation after him will coincide with the ninetieth year
after the same epoch; and therefore, deducting ten years for the
duration of the struggle, it will coincide with the eightieth year
after the capture of the city;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25"
class="fnanchor">[25]</a> thirty years being reckoned for a
generation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span>
date assigned by Thucydidês will thus agree with the distance in
which Têmenus, Kresphontês, and Aristodêmus, stand removed from
Hêraklês. The interval of eighty years, between the capture of Troy
and the Return of the Herakleids, appears to have been admitted by
Apollodôrus and Eratosthenês, and some other professed chronologists
of antiquity: but there were different reckonings which also found
more or less of support.</p>

<hr class="chap0" />


<div class="section pt3" id="Chap_1_18_2">
  <h3>SECTION II.—MIGRATION OF THESSALIANS AND BŒOTIANS.</h3>
</div>

<p class="mt1">In the same passage in which Thucydidês speaks of the
Return of the Herakleids, he also marks out the date of another event
a little antecedent, which is alleged to have powerfully affected
the condition of Northern Greece. “Sixty years after the capture of
Troy (he tells us) the Bœotians were driven by the Thessalians from
Arnê, and migrated into the land then called Kadmêïs, but now Bœotia,
wherein there had previously dwelt a section of their race, who had
contributed the contingent to the Trojan war.”</p>

<p>The expulsion here mentioned, of the Bœotians from Arnê “by
the Thessalians,” has been construed, with probability, to allude
to the immigration of the Thessalians, properly so called, from
the Thesprôtid in Epirus into Thessaly. That the Thessalians
had migrated into Thessaly from the Thesprôtid territory, is
stated by Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a> though he says nothing about time or
circumstances. Antiphus and Pheidippus appear in the Homeric
Catalogue as commanders of the Grecian contingent from the islands
of Kôs and Karpathus, on the south-east coast of Asia Minor: they
are sons of Thessalus, who is himself the son of Hêraklês. A legend
ran that these two chiefs, in the dispersion which ensued after
the victory, had been driven by storms into the Ionian Gulf, and
cast upon the coast of Epirus, where they landed and settled at
Ephyrê in the Thesprôtid.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27"
class="fnanchor">[27]</a> It was Thes<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span>salus, grandson of Pheidippus, who was
reported to have conducted the Thesprotians across the passes of
Pindus into Thessaly, to have conquered the fertile central plain of
that country, and to have imposed upon it his own name instead of its
previous denomination Æolis.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Whatever we may think of this legend as it stands, the state
of Thessaly during the historical ages renders it highly probable
that the Thessalians, properly so called, were a body of immigrant
conquerors. They appear always as a rude, warlike, violent, and
uncivilized race, distinct from their neighbors the Achæans, the
Magnetes, and the Perrhæbians, and holding all the three in tributary
dependence: these three tribes stand to them in a relation analogous
to that of the Lacedæmonian Periœki towards Sparta, while the
Penestæ, who cultivated their lands, are almost an exact parallel
of the Helots. Moreover, the low level of taste and intelligence
among the Thessalians, as well as certain points of their costume,
assimilates them more to Macedonians or Epirots than to Hellens.<a
id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Their
position in Thessaly is in many respects analogous to that of the
Spartan Dorians in Peloponnêsus, and there seems good reason for
concluding that the former, as well as the latter, were originally
victorious invaders, though we cannot pretend to determine the time
at which the invasion took place. The great family of the Aleuads,<a
id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and
probably other Thessalian families besides, were descendants of
Hêraklês, like the kings of Sparta.</p>

<p>There are no similar historical grounds, in the case of the
alleged migration of the Bœotians from Thessaly to Bœotia, to
justify a belief in the main fact of the legend, nor were the
different legendary stories in harmony one with the other. While the
Homeric Epic recognizes the Bœotians in Bœotia, but not in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span> Thessaly, Thucydidês
records a statement which he had found of their migration from the
latter into the former; but in order to escape the necessity of
flatly contradicting Homer, he inserts the parenthesis that there
had been previously an outlying fraction of Bœotians in Bœotia at
the time of the Trojan war,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a> from whom the troops who served with
Agamemnôn were drawn. Nevertheless, the discrepancy with the Iliad,
though less strikingly obvious, is not removed, inasmuch as the
Catalogue is unusually copious in enumerating the contingents from
Thessaly, without once mentioning Bœotians. Homer distinguishes
Orchomenus from Bœotia, and he does not specially notice Thêbes
in the Catalogue: in other respects his enumeration of the towns
coincides pretty well with the ground historically known afterwards
under the name of Bœotia.</p>

<p>Pausanias gives us a short sketch of the events which he supposes
to have intervened in this section of Greece between the Siege of
Troy and the Return of the Herakleids. Peneleôs, the leader of the
Bœotians at the siege, having been slain by Eurypylus the son of
Telephus, Tisamenus, son of Thersander and grandson of Polynikês,
acted as their commander, both during the remainder of the siege and
after their return. Autesiôn, his son and successor, became subject
to the wrath of the avenging Erinnyes of Laius and Œdipus: the oracle
directed him to expatriate, and he joined the Dorians. In his place,
Damasichthôn, son of Opheltas and grandson of Peneleôs, became king
of the Bœotians: he was succeeded by Ptolemæus, who was himself
followed by Xanthus. A war having broken out at that time between
the Athenians and Bœotians, Xanthus engaged in single combat with
Melanthus son of Andropompus, the champion of Attica, and perished by
the cunning of his opponent. After the death of Xanthus, the Bœotians
passed from kingship to popular government.<a id="FNanchor_32"
href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> As Melanthus was of
the lineage of the Neleids, and had migrated from Pylus to Athens
in consequence of the successful establishment of the Dorians in
Messênia, the duel with Xanthus must have been of course subsequent
to the Return of the Herakleids.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span></p> <p>Here, then, we have a summary of
alleged Bœotian history between the Siege of Troy and the Return of
the Herakleids, in which no mention is made of the immigration of the
mass of Bœotians from Thessaly, and seemingly no possibility left of
fitting in so great and capital an incident. The legends followed by
Pausanias are at variance with those adopted by Thucydidês, but they
harmonize much better with Homer.</p>

<p>So deservedly high is the authority of Thucydidês, that the
migration here distinctly announced by him is commonly set down as
an ascertained datum, historically as well as chronologically. But
on this occasion it can be shown that he only followed one amongst a
variety of discrepant legends, none of which there were any means of
verifying.</p>

<p>Pausanias recognized a migration of the Bœotians from Thessaly,
in early times anterior to the Trojan war;<a id="FNanchor_33"
href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and the account
of Ephorus, as given by Strabo, professed to record a series of
changes in the occupants of the country: First, the non-Hellenic
Aones and Temmikes, Leleges and Hyantes; next, the Kadmeians, who,
after the second siege of Thêbes by the Epigoni, were expelled by
the Thracians and Pelasgians, and retired into Thessaly, where they
joined in communion with the inhabitants of Arnê,—the whole aggregate
being called Bœotians. After the Trojan war, and about the time of
the Æolic emigration, these Bœotians returned from Thessaly and
reconquered Bœotia, driving out the Thracians and Pelasgians,—the
former retiring to Parnassus, the latter to Attica. It was on this
occasion (he says) that the Minyæ of Orchomenus were subdued, and
forcibly incorporated with the Bœotians. Ephorus seems to have
followed, in the main, the same narrative as Thucydidês, about the
movement of the Bœotians out of Thessaly; coupling it, however, with
several details current as explanatory of proverbs and customs.<a
id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span>The only
fact which we make out, independent of these legends, is, that
there existed certain homonymies and certain affinities of
religious worship, between parts of Bœotia and parts of Thessaly,
which appear to indicate a kindred race. A town named Arne,<a
id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
similar in name to the Thessalian, was enumerated in the Bœotian
Catalogue of Homer, and antiquaries identified it sometimes with the
historical town Chæroneia,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36"
class="fnanchor">[36]</a> sometimes with Akræphium. Moreover, there
was near the Bœotian Korôneia a river named Kuarius, or Koralius, and
a venerable temple dedicated to the Itonian Athênê, in the sacred
ground of which the Pambœotia, or public council of the Bœotian
name, was held; there was also a temple and a river of similar
denomination in Thessaly, near to a town called Iton, or Itônus.<a
id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> We
may from these circumstances presume a certain ancient kindred
between the population of these regions, and such a circumstance is
sufficient to explain the generation of legends describing migrations
backward and forward, whether true or not in point of fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span>What is most
important to remark is, that the stories of Thucydidês and Ephorus
bring us out of the mythical into the historical Bœotia. Orchomenus
is Bœotized, and we hear no more of the once-powerful Minyæ: there
are no more Kadmeians at Thêbes, nor Bœotians in Thessaly. The Minyæ
and the Kadmeians disappear in the Ionic emigration, which will
be presently adverted to. Historical Bœotia is now constituted,
apparently in its federative league, under the presidency of Thêbes,
just as we find it in the time of the Persian and Peloponnesian
wars.</p>

  <h3>SECTION III.—EMIGRATIONS FROM GREECE TO ASIA AND THE
    ISLANDS OF THE ÆGÆAN.</h3>
</div>

<p class="subsect">1. ÆOLIC.—2. IONIC.—3. DORIC.</p>

<p class="mt1">To complete the transition of Greece from its mythical
to its historical condition, the secession of the races belonging
to the former must follow upon the introduction of those belonging
to the latter. This is accomplished by means of the Æolic and Ionic
migrations.</p>

<p>The presiding chiefs of the Æolic emigration are the
representatives of the heroic lineage of the Pelopids: those of the
Ionic emigration belong to the Neleids: and even in what is called
the Doric emigration to Thêra, the Œkist Thêras is not a Dorian but a
Kadmeian, the legitimate descendant of Œdipus and Kadmus.</p>

<p>The Æolic, Ionic, and Doric colonies were planted along the
western coast of Asia Minor, from the coasts of the Propontis
southward down to Lykia (I shall in a future chapter speak more
exactly of their boundaries); the Æolic occupying the northern
portion, together with the islands of Lesbos and Tenedos; the Doric
occupying the southernmost, together with the neighboring islands
of Rhodes and Kôs; and the Ionic being planted between them,
comprehending Chios, Samos, and the Cycladês islands.</p>


<p class="subsect">1. ÆOLIC EMIGRATION.</p>

<p class="mt1">The Æolic emigration was conducted by the Pelopids:
the original story seems to have been, that Orestês himself was
at the head of the first batch of colonists, and this version of
the event<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[p. 20]</span> is
still preserved by Pindar and by Hellanikus.<a id="FNanchor_38"
href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But the more current
narratives represented the descendants of Orestês as chiefs of the
expeditions to Æolis,—his illegitimate son Penthilus, by Erigonê
daughter of Ægisthus,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a> together with Echelatus and Gras, the
son and grandson of Penthilus, together with Kleuês and Malaus,
descendants of Agamemnôn through another lineage. According to the
account given by Strabo, Orestês began the emigration, but died on
his route in Arcadia; his son Penthilus, taking the guidance of the
emigrants, conducted them by the long land-journey through Bœotia
and Thessaly to Thrace;<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40"
class="fnanchor">[40]</a> from whence Archelaus, son of Penthilus,
led them across the Hellespont, and settled at Daskylium on the
Propontis. Gras, son of Archelaus, crossed over to Lesbos and
possessed himself of the island. Kleuês and Malaus, conducting
another body of Achæans, were longer on their journey, and lingered
a considerable time near Mount Phrikium, in the territory of
Lokris; ultimately, however, they passed over by sea to Asia and
took possession of Kymê, south of the Gulf of Adramyttium, the
most considerable of all the Æolic cities on the continent.<a
id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> From
Lesbos and Kymê, the other less considerable Æolic towns, spreading
over the region of Ida as well as the Trôad, and comprehending the
island of Tenedos, are said to have derived their origin.</p>

<p>Though there are many differences in the details, the accounts
agree in representing these Æolic settlements as formed by the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span> Achæans expatriated
from Lacônia under the guidance of the dispossessed Pelopids.<a
id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
We are told that in their journey through Bœotia they received
considerable reinforcements, and Strabo adds that the emigrants
started from Aulis, the port from whence Agamemnôn departed in the
expedition against Troy.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> He also informs us that they missed their
course and experienced many losses from nautical ignorance, but we do
not know to what particular incidents he alludes.<a id="FNanchor_44"
href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>


<p class="subsect" id="Chap_1_18_3b">2. IONIC EMIGRATION.</p>

<p class="mt1">The Ionic emigration is described as emanating from
and directed by the Athenians, and connects itself with the previous
legendary history of Athens, which must therefore be here briefly
recapitulated.</p>

<p>The great mythical hero Thêseus, of whose military prowess and
errant exploits we have spoken in a previous chapter, was still more
memorable in the eyes of the Athenians as an internal political
reformer. He was supposed to have performed for them the inestimable
service of transforming Attica out of many states into one. Each
dême, or at least a great many out of the whole number, had before
his time enjoyed political independence under its own magistrates and
assemblies, acknowledging only a federal union with the rest under
the presidency of Athens: by a mixture of conciliation and force,
Thêseus succeeded in putting down all these separate governments,
and bringing them to unite in one political system, centralized at
Athens. He is said to have established a constitutional government,
retaining for himself a defined power as king, or president, and
distributing the people into three classes: Eupatridæ, a sort of
sacerdotal noblesse; Geômori and Demiurgi, husbandmen and artisans.<a
id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Having brought these important changes into efficient working,
he commemorated them for his posterity by introducing solemn and
appropriate festivals. In confirmation of the dominion of Athens over
the Megarid territory, he is said farther to have erected a pillar at
the extremity of the latter towards the Isthmus, marking the boundary
between Peloponnêsus and Iônia.</p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_22">[p. 22]</span></p> <p>But a revolution so extensive was
not consummated without creating much discontent; and Menestheus, the
rival of Thêseus,—the first specimen, as we are told, of an artful
demagogue,—took advantage of this feeling to assail and undermine
him. Thêseus had quitted Attica, to accompany and assist his friend
Peirithöus, in his journey down to the under-world, in order to
carry off the goddess Persephonê,—or (as those who were critical in
legendary story preferred recounting) in a journey to the residence
of Aidôneus, king of the Molossians in Epirus, to carry off his
daughter. In this enterprise, Peirithöus perished, while Thêseus
was cast into prison, from whence he was only liberated by the
intercession of Hêraklês. It was during his temporary absence, that
the Tyndarids Castôr and Pollux invaded Attica for the purpose of
recovering their sister Helen, whom Thêseus had at a former period
taken away from Sparta and deposited at Aphidnæ; and the partisans
of Menestheus took advantage both of the absence of Thêseus and of
the calamity which his licentiousness had brought upon the country,
to ruin his popularity with the people. When he returned, he found
them no longer disposed to endure his dominion, or to continue to him
the honors which their previous feelings of gratitude had conferred.
Having, therefore, placed his sons under the protection of Elephenôr,
in Eubœa, he sought an asylum with Lykomêdês, prince of Scyros,
from whom, however, he received nothing but an insidious welcome
and a traitorous death.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46"
class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Menestheus, succeeding to the honors of the expatriated hero,
commanded the Athenian troops at the Siege of Troy. But though
he survived the capture, he never returned to Athens,—different
stories being related of the place where he and his companions
settled. During this interval, the feelings of the Athenians
having changed, they restored the sons of Thêseus, who had served
at Troy under Elephenôr, and had returned unhurt, to the station
and functions of their father. The Theseids Demophoôn, Oxyntas,
Apheidas, and Thymœtês had successively filled this post for the
space of about sixty years,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47"
class="fnanchor">[47]</a> when the Dorian invaders of Peloponnêsus
(as has been before related) compelled Melanthus and the Neleid
family to abandon their kingdom of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span> Pylus. The refugees found shelter at
Athens, where a fortunate adventure soon raised Melanthus to the
throne. A war breaking out between the Athenians and Bœotians,
respecting the boundary tract of Œnoê, the Bœotian king Xanthus
challenged Thymœtês to single combat: the latter declining to accept
it, Melanthus not only stood forward in his place, but practised a
cunning stratagem with such success as to kill his adversary. He
was forthwith chosen king, Thymœtês being constrained to resign.<a
id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Melanthus and his son Kodrus reigned for nearly sixty years,
during which time large bodies of fugitives, escaping from the recent
invaders throughout Greece, were harbored by the Athenians: so that
Attica became populous enough to excite the alarm and jealousy of the
Peloponnesian Dorians. A powerful Dorian force, under the command
of Alêtês from Corinth and Althæmenês from Argos, were accordingly
despatched to invade the Athenian territory, in which the Delphian
oracle promised them success, provided they abstained from injuring
the person of Kodrus. Strict orders were given to the Dorian army
that Kodrus should be preserved unhurt; but the oracle had become
known among the Athenians,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49"
class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and the generous prince determined to bring
death upon himself as a means of salvation to his country. Assuming
the disguise of a peasant, he intentionally provoked a quarrel with
some of the Dorian troops, who slew him without suspecting his
real character. No sooner was this event known, than the Dorian
leaders, despairing of success, abandoned their<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_24">[p. 24]</span> enterprise and evacuated the country.<a
id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In
retiring, however, they retained possession of Megara, where they
established permanent settlers, and which became from this moment
Dorian,—seemingly at first a dependency of Corinth, though it
afterwards acquired its freedom and became an autonomous community.<a
id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
This memorable act of devoted patriotism, analogous to that of
the daughters of Erechtheus at Athens, and of Menœkeus at Thêbes,
entitled Kodrus to be ranked among the most splendid characters in
Grecian legend.</p>

<p>Kodrus is numbered as the last king of Athens: his descendants
were styled Archons, but they held that dignity for life,—a
practice which prevailed during a long course of years afterwards.
Medon and Neileus, his two sons, having quarrelled about the
succession, the Delphian oracle decided in favor of the former;
upon which the latter, affronted at the preference, resolved
upon seeking a new home.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52"
class="fnanchor">[52]</a> There were at this moment many dispossessed
sections of Greeks, and an adventitious population accumulated
in Attica, who were anxious for settlements beyond sea. The
expeditions which now set forth to cross the Ægean, chiefly under
the conduct of members of the Kodrid family, composed collectively
the memorable Ionic Emigration, of which the Ionians, recently
expelled from Peloponnêsus, formed a part, but, as it would seem,
only a small part; for we hear of many quite distinct races, some
renowned in legend, who withdraw from Greece amidst this assemblage
of colonists. The Kadmeians, the Minyæ of Orchomenus, the Abantês
of Eubœa, the Dryopes; the Molossi, the Phokians, the Bœotians,
the Arcadian Pelasgians, and even the Dorians of Epidaurus,—are
represented as furnishing each a proportion of the crews of
these emigrant vessels.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53"
class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Nor were the results unworthy of so
mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span> a confluence
of different races. Not only the Cyclades islands in the Ægean,
but the great islands of Samos and Chios, near the Asiatic coast,
and ten different cities on the coast of Asia Minor, from Milêtus
in the south to Phokæa in the north, were founded, and all adopted
the Ionic name. Athens was the metropolis or mother city of all of
them: Androklus and Neileus, the Œkists of Ephesus and Milêtus, and
probably other Œkists also, started from the Prytaneium at Athens,<a
id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> with
those solemnities, religious and political, which usually marked the
departure of a swarm of Grecian colonists.</p>

<p>Other mythical families, besides the heroic lineage of Nêleus and
Nestôr, as represented by the sons of Kodrus, took a leading part
in the expedition. Herodotus mentions Lykian chiefs, descendants
from Glaukus son of Hippolochus, and Pausanias tells us of Philôtas
descendant of Peneleôs, who went at the head of a body of Thebans:
both Glaukus and Peneleôs are commemorated in the Iliad.<a
id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> And
it is a remarkable fact mentioned by Pausanias (though we do not
know on what authority), that the inhabitants of Phokæa,—which was
the northernmost city of Iônia on the borders of Æolis, and one of
the last founded,—consisting mostly of Phokian colonists under the
conduct of the Athenians Philogenês and Dæmôn, were not admitted
into the Pan-Ionic Amphiktyony until they consented to choose
for themselves chiefs of the Kodrid family.<a id="FNanchor_56"
href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Proklês, the chief
who conducted the Ionic emigrants from Epidaurus to Samos, was said
to be of the lineage of Iôn, son of Xuthus.<a id="FNanchor_57"
href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Of the twelve Ionic states constituting the Pan-Ionic
Amphiktyony—some of them among the greatest cities in Hellas—I shall
say no more at present, as I have to treat of them again when I come
upon historical ground.</p>


<p class="subsect" id="Chap_1_18_3c">3. DORIC EMIGRATIONS.</p>

<p class="mt1">The Æolic and Ionic emigrations are thus both
presented to us as direct consequences of the event called the Return
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span> Herakleids:
and in like manner the formation of the Dorian Hexapolis in the
south-western corner of Asia Minor: Kôs, Knidus, Halikarnassus,
and Rhodes, with its three separate cities, as well as the Dorian
establishments in Krête, Melos, and Thêra, are all traced more or
less directly to the same great revolution.</p>

<p>Thêra, more especially, has its root in the legendary world. Its
Œkist was Thêras, a descendant of the heroic lineage of Œdipus and
Kadmus, and maternal uncle of the young kings of Sparta, Eurysthenês
and Proklês, during whose minority he had exercised the regency.
On their coming of age, his functions were at an end: but being
unable to endure a private station, he determined to put himself
at the head of a body of emigrants: many came forward to join him,
and the expedition was farther reinforced by a body of interlopers,
belonging to the Minyæ, of whom the Lacedæmonians were anxious
to get rid. These Minyæ had arrived in Laconia, not long before,
from the island of Lemnos, out of which they had been expelled by
the Pelasgian fugitives from Attica. They landed without asking
permission, took up their abode and began to “light their fires” on
Mount Taygetus. When the Lacedæmonians sent to ask who they were,
and wherefore they had come, the Minyæ replied that they were sons
of the Argonauts who had landed at Lemnos, and that, being expelled
from their own homes, they thought themselves entitled to solicit an
asylum in the territory of their fathers: they asked, withal, to be
admitted to share both the lands and the honors of the state. The
Lacedæmonians granted the request, chiefly on the ground of a common
ancestry,—their own great heroes, the Tyndarids, having been enrolled
in the crew of the Argô: the Minyæ were then introduced as citizens
into the tribes, received lots of land, and began to intermarry with
the preëxisting families. It was not long, however, before they
became insolent: they demanded a share in the kingdom (which was the
venerated privilege of the Herakleids), and so grossly misconducted
themselves in other ways, that the Lacedæmonians resolved to put them
to death, and began by casting them into prison. While the Minyæ
were thus confined, their wives, Spartans by birth, and many of them
daughters of the principal men, solicited permission to go in and see
them: leave being granted, they made use of the interview to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span> change clothes with their
husbands, who thus escaped and fled again to Mount Taygetus. The
greater number of them quitted Laconia, and marched to Triphylia,
in the western regions of Peloponnêsus, from whence they expelled
the Paroreatæ and the Kaukones, and founded six towns of their own,
of which Lepreum was the chief. A certain proportion, however, by
permission of the Lacedæmonians, joined Thêras, and departed with him
to the island of Kallistê, then possessed by Phœnician inhabitants,
who were descended from the kinsmen and companions of Kadmus, and
who had been left there by that prince, when he came forth in search
of Eurôpa, eight generations preceding. Arriving thus among men of
kindred lineage with himself, Thêras met with a fraternal reception,
and the island derived from him the name, under which it is
historically known, of Thêra.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>Such is the foundation-legend of Thêra, believed both by the
Lacedæmonians and by the Theræans, and interesting as it brings
before us, characteristically as well as vividly, the persons and
feelings of the mythical world,—the Argonauts, with the Tyndarids as
their companions and Minyæ as their children. In Lepreum, as in the
other towns of Triphylia, the descent from the Minyæ of old seems
to have been believed in the historical times, and the mention of
the river Minyëius in those regions by Homer tended to confirm it.<a
id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> But
people were not unanimous as to the legend by which that descent
should be made out; while some adopted the story just cited from
Herodotus, others imagined that Chlôris, who had come from the
Minyeian town of Orchomenus as the wife of Nêleus to Pylus, had
brought with her a body of her countrymen.<a id="FNanchor_60"
href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span>These Minyæ
from Lemnos and Imbros appear again as portions of another narrative
respecting the settlement of the colony of Mêlos. It has already been
mentioned, that when the Herakleids and the Dorians invaded Lacônia,
Philonomus, an Achæan, treacherously betrayed to them the country,
for which he received as his recompense the territory of Amyklæ. He
is said to have peopled this territory by introducing detachments
of Minyæ from Lemnos and Imbros, who, in the third generation after
the return of the Herakleids, became so discontented and mutinous,
that the Lacedæmonians resolved to send them out of the country
as emigrants, under their chiefs Polis and Delphus. Taking the
direction of Krête, they stopped in their way to land a portion of
their colonists on the island of Mêlos, which remained throughout
the historical times a faithful and attached colony of Lacedæmôn.<a
id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
On arriving in Krête, they are said to have settled at the town
of Gortyn. We find, moreover, that other Dorian establishments,
either from Lacedæmôn or Argos, were formed in Krête; and Lyktos
in particular, is noticed, not only as a colony of Sparta, but
as distinguished for the analogy of its laws and customs.<a
id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It
is even said that Krête, immediately after the Trojan war, had
been visited by the wrath of the gods, and depopulated by famine
and pestilence; and that, in the third generation afterwards,
so great was the influx of emigrants, the entire population of
the island was renewed, with the exception of the Eteokrêtes
at Polichnæ and Præsus.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63"
class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[p. 29]</span>There were
Dorians in Krête in the time of the Odyssey: Homer mentions different
languages and different races of men, Eteokrêtes, Kydônes, Dorians,
Achæans, and Pelasgians, as all coexisting in the island, which he
describes to be populous, and to contain ninety cities. A legend
given by Andrôn, based seemingly upon the statement of Herodotus,
that Dôrus the son of Hellen had settled in Histiæôtis, ascribed
the first introduction of the three last races to Tektaphus son of
Dôrus,—who had led forth from that country a colony of Dorians,
Achæans, and Pelasgians, and had landed in Krête during the reign
of the indigenous king Krês.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64"
class="fnanchor">[64]</a> This story of Andrôn so exactly fits on to
the Homeric Catalogue of Kretan inhabitants, that we may reasonably
presume it to have been designedly arranged with reference to that
Catalogue, so as to afford some plausible account, consistently with
the received legendary chronology, how there came to be Dorians in
Krête before the Trojan war,—the Dorian colonies after the return of
the Herakleids being of course long posterior in supposed order of
time. To find a leader sufficiently early for his hypothesis, Andrôn
ascends to the primitive Eponymus Dôrus, to whose son Tektaphus he
ascribes the introduction of a mixed colony of Dorians, Achæans, and
Pelasgians into Krête: these are the exact three races enumerated
in the Odyssey, and the king Krês, whom Andrôn affirms to have been
then reigning in the island, represents the Eteokrêtes and Kydônes in
the list of Homer. The story seems to have found favor among native
Kretan historians, as it doubtless serves to obviate what<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span> would otherwise be
a contradiction in the legendary chronology.<a id="FNanchor_65"
href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Another Dorian emigration from Peloponnêsus to Krête, which
extended also to Rhodes and Kôs, is farther said to have been
conducted by Althæmenês, who had been one of the chiefs in the
expedition against Attica, in which Krodus perished. This prince,
a Herakleid, and third in descent from Têmenus, was induced to
expatriate by a family quarrel, and conducted a body of Dorian
colonists from Argos first to Krête, where some of them remained;
but the greater number accompanied him to Rhodes, in which island,
after expelling the Karian possessors, he founded the three cities of
Lindus, Ialysus, and Kameirus.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>It is proper here to add, that the legend of the Rhodian
archæologists respecting their œkist Althæmenês, who was worshipped
in the island with heroic honors, was something totally different
from the preceding. Althæmenês was a Kretan, son of the king Katreus,
and grandson of Minos. An oracle predicted to him that he would
one day kill his father: eager to escape so terrible a destiny, he
quitted Krête, and conducted a colony to Rhodes, where the famous
temple of the Atabyrian Zeus, on the lofty summit of Mount Atabyrum,
was ascribed to his foundation, built so as to command a view of
Krête. He had been settled on the island for some time, when his
father Katreus, anxious again to embrace his only son, followed
him from Krête: he landed in Rhodes during the night without being
known, and a casual collision took place between his attendants
and the islanders. Althæmenês hastened to the shore to assist in
repelling the supposed enemies, and in the fray had the misfortune
to kill his aged father.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Either the emigrants who accompanied Althæmenês, or some<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span> other Dorian colonists
afterwards, are reported to have settled at Kôs, Knidus, Karpathus,
and Halikarnassus. To the last mentioned city, however, Anthês of
Trœzên is assigned as the œkist: the emigrants who accompanied him
were said to have belonged to the Dymanian tribe, one of the three
tribes always found in a Doric state: and the city seems to have been
characterized as a colony sometimes of Trœzên, sometimes of Argos.<a
id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>


<p class="mt3" id="Chap_1_18_3d">We thus have the Æolic, the Ionic,
and the Doric colonial establishments in Asia, all springing out
of the legendary age, and all set forth as consequences, direct
or indirect, of what is called the Return of the Herakleids, or
the Dorian conquest of Peloponnêsus. According to the received
chronology, they are succeeded by a period, supposed to comprise
nearly three centuries, which is almost an entire blank, before we
reach authentic chronology and the first recorded Olympiad,—and
they thus form the concluding events of the mythical world, out of
which we now pass into historical Greece, such as it stands at the
last-mentioned epoch. It is by these migrations that the parts of
the Hellenic aggregate are distributed into the places which they
occupy at the dawn of historical daylight,—Dorians, Arcadians,
Ætolo-Eleians, and Achæans, sharing Peloponnêsus unequally among
them,—Æolians, Ionians, and Dorians, settled both in the islands of
the Ægean and the coast of Asia Minor. The Return of the Herakleids,
as well as the three emigrations, Æolic, Ionic, and Doric, present
the legendary explanation, suitable to the feelings and belief of the
people, showing how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span>
Greece passed from the heroic races who besieged Troy and Thêbes,
piloted the adventurous Argô, and slew the monstrous boar of Kalydôn,
to the historical races, differently named and classified, who
furnished victors to the Olympic and Pythian games.</p>

<p>A patient and learned French writer, M. Raoul Rochette,—who
construes all the events of the heroic age, generally speaking,
as so much real history, only making allowance for the mistakes
and exaggerations of poets,—is greatly perplexed by the blank and
interruption which this supposed continuous series of history
presents, from the Return of the Herakleids down to the beginning
of the Olympiads. He cannot explain to himself so long a period of
absolute quiescence, after the important incidents and striking
adventures of the heroic age; and if there happened nothing worthy
of record during this long period,—as he presumes, from the fact
that nothing has been transmitted,—he concludes that this must have
arisen from the state of suffering and exhaustion in which previous
wars and revolution had left the Greeks: a long interval of complete
inaction being required to heal such wounds.<a id="FNanchor_69"
href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span></p> <p>Assuming M.
Rochette’s view of the heroic ages to be correct, and reasoning upon
the supposition that the adventures ascribed to the Grecian heroes
are matters of historical reality, transmitted by tradition from a
period of time four centuries before the recorded Olympiads, and only
embellished by describing poets,—the blank which he here dwells upon
is, to say the least of it, embarrassing and unaccountable. It is
strange that the stream of tradition, if it had once begun to flow,
should (like several of the rivers in Greece) be submerged for two or
three centuries and then reappear. But when we make what appears to
me the proper distinction between legend and history, it will be seen
that a period of blank time between the two is perfectly conformable
to the conditions under which the former is generated. It is not
the immediate past, but a supposed remote past, which forms the
suitable atmosphere of mythical narrative,—a past originally quite
undetermined in respect to distance from the present, as we see in
the Iliad and Odyssey. And even when we come down to the genealogical
poets, who affect to give a certain measure of bygone time, and a
succession of persons as well as of events, still, the names whom
they most delight to honor and upon whose exploits they chiefly
expatiate, are those of the ancestral gods and heroes of the tribe
and their supposed contemporaries; ancestors separated by a long
lineage from the present hearer. The gods and heroes were conceived
as removed from him by several generations, and the legendary matter
which was grouped around them appeared only the more imposing when
exhibited at a respectful distance, beyond the days of father and
grandfather, and of all known predecessors. The Odes of Pindar
strikingly illustrate this tendency. We thus see how it happened
that, between the times assigned to heroic adventure and those of
historical record, there existed an intermediate blank, filled with
inglorious names; and how, amongst the same society which cared not
to remember proceedings of fathers and grandfathers, there circulated
much popular and accredited narrative respecting real or supposed
ancestors long past and gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p.
34]</span> The obscure and barren centuries which immediately precede
the first recorded Olympiad, form the natural separation between
the legendary return of the Herakleids and the historical wars of
Sparta against Messênê,—between the province of legend, wherein
matter of fact (if any there be) is so intimately combined with its
accompaniments of fiction, as to be undistinguishable without the aid
of extrinsic evidence,—and that of history where some matters of fact
can be ascertained, and where a sagacious criticism may be usefully
employed in trying to add to their number.</p>

    APPLICATION OF CHRONOLOGY TO GRECIAN LEGEND.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">I need</span> not repeat, what
has already been sufficiently set forth in the preceding pages, that
the mass of Grecian incident anterior to 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
appears to me not reducible either to history or to chronology, and
that any chronological system which may be applied to it must be
essentially uncertified and illusory. It was, however, chronologized
in ancient times, and has continued to be so in modern; and the
various schemes employed for this purpose may be found stated and
compared in the first volume (the last published) of Mr. Fynes
Clinton’s Fasti Hellenici. There were among the Greeks, and there
still are among modern scholars, important differences as to the
dates of the principal events:<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Eratosthenês dissented both from
Herodotus and from Phanias and Kallimachus, while Larcher and Raoul
Rochette<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span> (who
follow Herodotus) stand opposed to O. Müller and to Mr. Clinton. That
the reader may have a general conception of the order in which these
legendary events were disposed, I transcribe from the Fasti Hellenica
a double chronological table, contained in p. 139, in which the dates
are placed in series, from Phorôneus to the Olympiad of Corœbus in
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 776,—in the first column according to the system
of Eratosthenês, in the second according to that of Kallimachus.</p>

<p>“The following Table (says Mr. Clinton) offers a summary view
of the leading periods from Phorôneus to the Olympiad of Corœbus,
and exhibits a double series of dates; the one proceeding from the
date of Eratosthenês, the other from a date founded on the reduced
calculations of Phanias and Kallimachus, which strike out fifty-six
years from the amount of Eratosthenês. Phanias, as we have seen,
omitted fifty-five years between the Return and the registered
Olympiads; for so we may understand the account: Kallimachus,
fifty-six years between the Olympiad of Iphitus and the Olympiad
in which Corœbus won.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71"

<p class="mt1"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p.
37]</span>Wherever chronology is possible, researches such as
those of Mr. Clinton, which have conduced so much to the better
understanding of the later times of Greece, deserve respectful
attention. But the ablest chronologist can accomplish nothing,
unless he is supplied with a certain basis of matters of fact, pure
and distinguishable from fiction, and authenticated by witnesses
both knowing the truth and willing to declare it. Possessing
this preliminary stock, he may reason from it to refute distinct
falsehoods and to correct partial mistakes: but if all the original
statements submitted to him contain truth (at least wherever there
is truth) in a sort of chemical combination with fiction, which
he has no means of decomposing,—he is in the condition of one who
tries to solve a problem without data: he is first obliged to
construct his own data, and from them to extract his conclusions.
The statements of the epic poets, our only original witnesses in
this case, correspond to the description here given. Whether the
proportion of truth contained in them be smaller or greater, it is
at all events unassignable,—and the constant and intimate admixture
of fiction is both indisputable in itself, and, indeed, essential to
the purpose and profession of those from whom the tales proceed. Of
such a character are all the deposing witnesses, even where their
tales agree; and it is out of a heap of such tales, not agreeing,
but discrepant in a thousand ways, and without a morsel of pure
authenticated truth,—that the critic is called upon to draw out a
methodical series of historical events adorned with chronological
dates.</p>

<p>If we could imagine a modern critical scholar transported into
Greece at the time of the Persian war,—endued with his present
habits of appreciating historical evidence, without sharing in
the religious or patriotic feelings of the country,—and invited
to prepare, out of the great body of Grecian epic which then
existed, a History and Chronology of Greece anterior to 776
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, assigning reasons as well for what he
admitted as for what he rejected,—I feel persuaded that he would
have judged the undertaking to be little better than a process of
guesswork. But the modern critic finds that not only Pherekydês and
Hellanikus, but also Herodotus and Thucydidês, have either attempted
the task or sanctioned the belief that it was practicable,—a matter
not at all surprising, when we consider both their narrow ex<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span>perience of historical
evidence and the powerful ascendency of religion and patriotism in
predisposing them to antiquarian belief,—and he therefore accepts the
problem as they have bequeathed it, adding his own efforts to bring
it to a satisfactory solution. Nevertheless, he not only follows them
with some degree of reserve and uneasiness, but even admits important
distinctions quite foreign to their habits of thought. Thucydidês
talks of the deeds of Hellên and his sons with as much confidence as
we now speak of William the Conqueror: Mr. Clinton recognizes Hellên,
with his sons Dôrus, Æolus, and Xuthus, as fictitious persons.
Herodotus recites the great heroic genealogies down from Kadmus
and Danaus, with a belief not less complete in the higher members
of the series than in the lower: but Mr. Clinton admits a radical
distinction in the evidence of events before and after the first
recorded Olympiad, or 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—“the first date
in Grecian chronology (he remarks, p. 123) which can be fixed upon
<i>authentic evidence</i>,”—the highest point to which Grecian chronology,
<i>reckoning upward</i>, can be carried. Of this important epoch in
Grecian development,—the commencement of authentic chronological
life,—Herodotus and Thucydidês had no knowledge or took no account:
the later chronologists, from Timæus downwards, noted it, and made
it serve as the basis of their chronological comparisons, so far
as it went: but neither Eratosthenês nor Apollodôrus seem to have
recognized (though Varro and Africanus did recognize) a marked
difference in respect of certainty or authenticity between the period
before and the period after.</p>

<p>In farther illustration of Mr. Clinton’s opinion that the first
recorded Olympiad is the earliest date which can be fixed upon
authentic evidence, we have, in p. 138, the following just remarks
in reference to the dissentient views of Eratosthenês, Phanias,
and Kallimachus, about the date of the Trojan war: “The chronology
of Eratosthenês (he says), founded on a careful comparison of
circumstances, and approved by those to whom the same stores of
information were open, is entitled to our respect. But we must
remember that a conjectural date can never rise to the authority of
evidence; that what is accepted as a substitute for testimony is
not an equivalent: witnesses only can prove a date, and in the want
of these, the knowledge of it is plainly beyond our reach.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p. 39]</span> If in the absence of a
better light we seek for what is probable, we are not to forget the
distinction between conjecture and proof; between what is probable
and what is certain. The computation, then, of Eratosthenês for
the war of Troy is open to inquiry; and if we find it adverse to
the opinions of many preceding writers, who fixed a lower date,
and adverse to the acknowledged length of generation in the most
authentic dynasties, we are allowed to follow other guides, who give
us a lower epoch.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Clinton again plainly acknowledges the want of evidence,
and the irremediable uncertainty of Grecian chronology before the
Olympiads; and the reasonable conclusion from his argument is, not
simply, that “the computation of Eratosthenês was open to inquiry,”
(which few would be found to deny,) but that both Eratosthenês and
Phanias had delivered positive opinions upon a point on which no
sufficient evidence was accessible, and therefore that neither the
one nor the other was a guide to be followed.<a id="FNanchor_73"
href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Mr. Clinton does,
indeed, speak of authentic dynasties prior to the first recorded
Olympiad, but if there be any such, reaching up from that period to
a supposed point coeval with or anterior to the war of Troy,—I see
no good reason for the marked distinction which he draws between
chronology before and chronology after the Olympiad of Korœbus,
or for the necessity which he feels of suspending his upward
reckoning at the last-mentioned epoch, and beginning a different
process, called “a downward reckoning,” from the higher epoch
(supposed to be somehow ascertained without any upward reckoning)
of the first patriarch from whom such authentic dynasty emanates.<a
id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Herodotus and Thucydidês might well, upon this supposition, ask
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span> Mr. Clinton,
why he called upon them to alter their method of proceeding at the
year 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and why they might not be allowed to
pursue their “upward chronological reckoning,” without interruption,
from Leonidas up to Danaus, or from Peisistratus up to Hellên and
Deukalion, without any alteration in the point of view. Authentic
dynasties from the Olympiads, up to an epoch above the Trojan war,
would enable us to obtain chronological proof for the latter date,
instead of being reduced (as Mr. Clinton affirms that we are) to
“conjecture” instead of proof.</p>

<p>The whole question, as to the value of the reckoning from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span> Olympiads up to
Phorôneus, does in truth turn upon this point: Are those genealogies,
which profess to cover the space between the two, authentic and
trustworthy, or not? Mr. Clinton appears to feel that they are not
so, when he admits the essential difference in the character of the
evidence and the necessity of altering the method of computation,
before and after the first recorded Olympiad; yet, in his Preface,
he labors to prove that they possess historical worth and are in the
main correctly set forth: moreover, that the fictitious persons,
wherever any such are intermingled, may be detected and eliminated.
The evidences upon which he relies, are: 1. Inscriptions; 2. The
early poets.</p>

<p>1. An inscription, being nothing but a piece of writing on marble,
carries evidentiary value under the same conditions as a published
writing on paper. If the inscriber reports a contemporary fact which
he had the means of knowing, and if there be no reason to suspect
misrepresentation, we believe his assertion: if, on the other hand,
he records facts belonging to a long period before his own time, his
authority counts for little, except in so far as we can verify and
appreciate his means of knowledge.</p>

<p>In estimating, therefore, the probative force of any inscription,
the first and most indispensable point is to assure ourselves of its
date. Amongst all the public registers and inscriptions alluded to
by Mr. Clinton, there is not one which can be positively referred
to a date anterior to 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> The quoit of
Iphitus,—the public registers at Sparta, Corinth, and Elis,—the list
of the priestesses of Juno at Argos,—are all of a date completely
uncertified. O. Müller does, indeed, agree with Mr. Clinton (though
in my opinion without any sufficient proof) in assigning the quoit of
Iphitus to the age ascribed to that prince: and if we even grant thus
much, we shall have an inscription as old (adopting Mr. Clinton’s
determination of the age of Iphitus) as 828 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
But when Mr. Clinton quotes O. Müller as admitting the registers of
Sparta, Corinth, and Elis, it is right to add that the latter does
not profess to guarantee the authenticity of these documents, or
the age at which such registers began to be kept. It is not to be
doubted that there were registers of the kings of Sparta carrying
them up to Hêraklês, and of the kings of Elis from Oxylus to
Iphitus; but the question is, at what time did these lists begin to
be kept continuously? This is a point which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span> we have no means of deciding, nor can
we accept Mr. Clinton’s unsupported conjecture, when he tells us:
“<i>Perhaps</i> these were begun to be written as early as <small>B.
C.</small> 1048, the probable time of the Dorian conquest.” Again, he
tells us: “At Argos, a register was preserved of the priestesses of
Juno, which <i>might</i> be more ancient than the catalogues of the kings
of Sparta or Corinth. That register, from which Hellanikus composed
his work, contained the priestesses from the earliest times down to
the age of Hellanikus himself.... But this catalogue <i>might have</i>
been commenced as early as the Trojan war itself, and even at a still
earlier date.” (pp. x. xi.) Again, respecting the inscriptions quoted
by Herodotus from the temple of the Ismenian Apollo at Thêbes, in
which Amphitryo and Laodamas are named, Mr. Clinton says, “They were
ancient in the time of Herodotus, which <i>may</i> perhaps carry them back
400 years before his time: and in that case they <i>might</i> approach
within 300 years of Laodamas and within 400 years of the probable
time of Kadmus himself.”—“It is granted (he adds, in a note,) that
these inscriptions were <i>not genuine</i>, that is, not of the date to
which they were assigned by Herodotus himself. But that they were
ancient, cannot be doubted,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>The time when Herodotus saw the temple of the Ismenian Apollo at
Thêbes can hardly have been earlier than 450 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
reckoning upwards from hence to 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, we have an
interval of 326 years: the inscriptions which Herodotus saw may well
therefore have been <i>ancient</i>, without being earlier than the first
recorded Olympiad. Mr. Clinton does, indeed, tell us that <i>ancient</i>
“may perhaps” be construed as 400 years earlier than Herodotus. But
no careful reader can permit himself to convert such bare possibility
into a ground of inference, and to make it available, in conjunction
with other similar possibilities before enumerated, for the purpose
of showing that there really existed inscriptions in Greece of a date
anterior to 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Unless Mr. Clinton can make out
this, he can derive no benefit from inscriptions, in his attempt to
substantiate the reality of the mythical persons or of the mythical
events.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the Herakleid pedigree of the Spartan kings
(as has been observed in a former chapter) is only one out of the
numerous divine and heroic genealogies with which the Hel<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span>lenic world abounded,<a
id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>—a
class of documents which become historical evidence only so high in
the ascending series as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p.
44]</span> names composing them are authenticated by contemporary,
or nearly contemporary, enrolment. At what period this practice of
enrolment began, we have no information. Two remarks, however, may
be made, in reference to any approximative guess as to the time
when actual registration commenced: First, that the number of names
in the pedigree, or the length of past time which it professes to
embrace, affords no presumption of any superior antiquity in the
time of registration: Secondly, that, looking to the acknowledged
paucity and rudeness of Grecian writing, even down to the 60th
Olympiad (540 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), and to the absence of the
habit of writing, as well as the low estimate of its value, which
such a state of things argues, the presumption is, that written
enrolment of family genealogies, did not commence until a long time
after 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and the obligation of proof
falls upon him who maintains that it commenced earlier. And this
second remark is farther borne out, when we observe that there is
no registered list, except that of the Olympic victors, which goes
up even so high as 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> The next list
which O. Müller and Mr. Clinton produce, is that of the Karneonicæ,
or victors at the Karneian festival, which reaches only up to 676
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

<p>If Mr. Clinton then makes little out of inscriptions to sustain
his view of Grecian history and chronology anterior to the recorded
Olympiads, let us examine the inferences which he draws from his
ether source of evidence,—the early poets. And here it will be
found, First, that in order to maintain the credibility of these
witnesses, he lays down positions respecting historical evidence
both indefensible in themselves, and especially inapplicable to the
early times of Greece: Secondly, that his reasoning is at the same
time inconsistent,—inasmuch as it includes admissions, which, if
properly understood and followed out, exhibit these very witnesses as
habitually, indiscriminately, and unconsciously mingling truth and
fiction; and therefore little fit to be believed upon their solitary
and unsupported testimony.</p>

<p>To take the second point first, he says, Introduction, p. ii-iii:
“The authority even of the genealogies has been called in ques<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span>tion by many able and
learned persons, who reject Danaus, Kadmus, Hercules, Thêseus, and
many others, as fictitious persons. It is evident that any fact would
come from the hands of the poets embellished with many fabulous
additions: and fictitious genealogies were undoubtedly composed.
Because, however, some genealogies were fictitious, we are not
justified in concluding that all were fabulous.... In estimating,
then, the historical value of the genealogies transmitted by the
early poets, we may take a middle course; not rejecting them
as wholly false, nor yet implicitly receiving all as true. The
genealogies <i>contain many real persons</i>, but these are <i>incorporated
with many fictitious names</i>. The fictions, however, will have a
basis of truth: the genealogical expression may be false, but the
connection which it describes is real. Even to those who reject
the whole as fabulous, the exhibition of the early times which is
presented in this volume may still be not unacceptable: because it is
necessary to the right understanding of antiquity that the opinions
of the Greeks concerning their own origin should be set before us,
even if these are erroneous opinions, and that their story should
be told as they have told it themselves. The names preserved by
the ancient genealogies may be considered of three kinds; either
they were the name of a race or clan converted into the name of an
individual, or they were altogether fictitious, or lastly, they were
real historical names. An attempt is made, in the four genealogical
tables inserted below, to distinguish these three classes of
names.... Of those who are left in the third class (<i>i. e.</i> the real)
all are not entitled to remain there. But I have only placed in the
third class those names concerning which there seemed to be little
doubt. The rest are left to the judgment of the reader.”</p>

<p>Pursuant to this principle of division, Mr. Clinton furnishes
four genealogical tables,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76"
class="fnanchor">[76]</a> in which the names of persons representing
races are printed in capital letters, and those of purely fictitious
persons in italics. And these tables exhibit a curious sample of the
intimate commixture of fiction with that which he calls truth: real
son and mythical father, real husband and mythical wife, or <i>vice
versâ</i>.</p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span></p>
<p>Upon Mr. Clinton’s tables we may remark:—</p>

<p>1. The names singled out as fictitious are distinguished by no
common character, nor any mark either assignable or defensible, from
those which are left as real. To take an example (p. 40), why is
Itônus the first pointed out as a fiction, while Itônus the second,
together with Physcus, Cynus, Salmôneus, Ormenus, etc., in the same
page, are preserved as real, all of them being eponyms of towns just
as much as Itônus?</p>

<p>2. If we are to discard Hellên, Dôrus, Æolus, Iôn, etc., as not
being real individual persons, but expressions for personified
races, why are we to retain Kadmus, Danaus, Hyllus, and several
others, who are just as much eponyms of races and tribes as the
four above mentioned? Hyllus, Pamphylus, and Dymas are the eponyms
of the three Dorian tribes,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77"
class="fnanchor">[77]</a> just as Hoplês and the other three sons of
Iôn were of the four Attic tribes: Kadmus and Danaus stand in the
same relation to the Kadmeians and Danaans, as Argus and Achæus to
the Argeians and Achæans. Besides, there are many other names really
eponymous, which we cannot now recognize to be so, in consequence
of our imperfect acquaintance with the subdivisions of the Hellenic
population, each of which, speaking generally, had its god or hero,
to whom the original of the name was referred. If, then, eponymous
names are to be excluded from the category of reality, we shall find
that the ranks of the real men will be thinned to a far greater
extent than is indicated by Mr. Clinton’s tables.</p>

<p>3. Though Mr. Clinton does not carry out consistently either of
his disfranchising qualifications among the names and persons of
the old mythes, he nevertheless presses them far enough to strike
out a sensible proportion of the whole. By conceding thus much
to modern scepticism, he has departed from the point of view of
Hellanikus and Herodotus, and the ancient historians generally; and
it is singular that the names, which he has been the most forward
to sacrifice, are exactly those to which they were most attached,
and which it would have been most painful to their faith to part
with,—I mean the eponymous heroes. Neither Herodotus, nor Hellanikus,
nor Eratosthenês, nor any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p.
47]</span> one of the chronological reckoners of antiquity, would
have admitted the distinction which Mr. Clinton draws between persons
real and persons fictitious in the old mythical world, though they
might perhaps occasionally, on special grounds, call in question
the existence of some individual characters amongst the mythical
ancestry of Greece; but they never dreamed of that general severance
into real and fictitious persons, which forms the principle of
Mr. Clinton’s “middle course.” Their chronological computations
for Grecian antiquity assumed that the mythical characters, in
their full and entire sequence, were all real persons. Setting up
the entire list as real, they calculated so many generations to a
century, and thus determined the number of centuries which separated
themselves from the gods, the heroes, or the autochthonous men who
formed in their view the historical starting point. But as soon
as it is admitted that the personages in the mythical world are
divisible into two classes, partly real and partly fictitious,
the integrity of the series is broken up, and it can be no longer
employed as a basis for chronological calculation. In the estimate
of the ancient chronologers, three succeeding persons of the same
lineage—grandfather, father, and son,—counted for a century;
and this may pass in a rough way, so long as you are thoroughly
satisfied that they are all real persons: but if, in the succession
of persons A, B, C, you strike out B as a fiction, the continuity
of data necessary for chronological computation disappears. Now Mr.
Clinton is inconsistent with himself in this,—that, while he abandons
the unsuspecting historical faith of the Grecian chronologers, he
nevertheless continues his chronological computations upon the data
of that ancient faith,—upon the assumed reality of all the persons
constituting his ante-historical generations. What becomes, for
example, of the Herakleid genealogy of the Spartan kings, when it
is admitted that eponymous persons are to be cancelled as fictions;
seeing that Hyllus, through whom those kings traced their origin to
Hêraklês comes in the most distinct manner under that category, as
much so as Hoplês the son of Iôn? It will be found that, when we
once cease to believe in the mythical world as an uninterrupted and
unalloyed succession of real individuals, it becomes unfit to serve
as a basis for chronological computations, and that Mr. Clinton, when
he mutilated the data of the ancient chronolo<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_48">[p. 48]</span>gists, ought at the same time to have
abandoned their problems as insoluble. Genealogies of real persons,
such as Herodotus and Eratosthenês believed in, afford a tolerable
basis for calculations of time, within certain limits of error:
“genealogies containing many real persons, but incorporated with many
fictitious names,” (to use the language just cited from Mr. Clinton,)
are essentially unavailable for such a purpose.</p>

<p>It is right here to add, that I agree in Mr. Clinton’s view of
these eponymous persons: I admit, with him, that “the genealogical
expression may often be false, when the connection which it describes
is real.” Thus, for example, the adoption of Hyllus by Ægimius, the
father of Pamphylus and Dymas, to the privileges of a son and to a
third fraction of his territories, may reasonably be construed as
a mythical expression of the fraternal union of the three Dorian
tribes, Hyllêis, Pamphyli, and Dymanes: so about the relationship of
Iôn and Achæus, of Dôrus and Æolus. But if we put this construction
on the name of Hyllus, or Iôn, or Achæus, we cannot at the same time
employ either of these persons as units in chronological reckoning:
nor is it consistent to recognize them in the lump as members of
a distinct class, and yet to enlist them as real individuals in
measuring the duration of past time.</p>

<p>4. Mr. Clinton, while professing a wish to tell the story of
the Greeks as they have told it themselves, seems unconscious how
capitally his point of view differs from theirs. The distinction
which he draws between real and fictitious persons would have
appeared unreasonable, not to say offensive, to Herodotus or
Eratosthenês. It is undoubtedly right that the early history (if so
it is to be called) of the Greeks should be told as they have told
it themselves, and with that view I have endeavored in the previous
narrative, as far as I could, to present the primitive legends in
their original color and character,—pointing out at the same time
the manner in which they were transformed and distilled into history
by passing through the retort of later annalists. It is the legend,
as thus transformed, which Mr. Clinton seems to understand as the
story told by the Greeks themselves,—which cannot be admitted to be
true, unless the meaning of the expression be specially explained.
In his general distinction, however, between the real and fictitious
persons of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span>
mythical world, he departs essentially from the point of view even
of the later Greeks. And if he had consistently followed out that
distinction in his particular criticisms, he would have found
the ground slipping under his feet in his upward march even to
Troy,—not to mention the series of eighteen generations farther up,
to Phorôneus; but he does <i>not</i> consistently follow it out, and
therefore, in practice, he deviates little from the footsteps of the
ancients.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show that the witnesses upon whom Mr.
Clinton relies, blend truth and fiction habitually, indiscriminately,
and unconsciously, even upon his own admission. Let us now consider
the positions which he lays down respecting historical evidence. He
says (Introduct. pp. vi-vii):—</p>

<p>“We may acknowledge as real persons all those whom there is no
reason for rejecting. The presumption is in favor of the early
tradition, if no argument can be brought to overthrow it. The persons
may be considered real, when the description of them is consonant
with the state of the country at that time: when no national
prejudice or vanity could be concerned in inventing them: when the
tradition is consistent and general: when rival or hostile tribes
concur in the leading facts: when the acts ascribed to the person
(divested of their poetical ornament) enter into the political system
of the age, or form the basis of other transactions which fall
within known historical times. Kadmus and Danaus appear to be real
persons: for it is conformable to the state of mankind, and perfectly
credible, that Phœnician and Egyptian adventurers, in the ages to
which these persons are ascribed, should have found their way to the
coasts of Greece: and the Greeks (as already observed) had no motive
from any national vanity to feign these settlements. Hercules was a
real person. His acts were recorded by those who were not friendly
to the Dorians; by Achæans and Æolians, and Ionians, who had no
vanity to gratify in celebrating the hero of a hostile and rival
people. His descendants in many branches remained in many states
down to the historical times. His son Tlepolemus, and his grandson
and great-grandson Cleodæus and Aristomachus, are acknowledged (<i>i.
e.</i> by O. Müller) to be real persons: and there is no reason that
can be assigned for receiving these, which will not be equally valid
for establishing the reality both of Her<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_50">[p. 50]</span>cules and Hyllus. Above all, Hercules is
authenticated by the testimonies both of the Iliad and Odyssey.”</p>

<p>These positions appear to me inconsistent with any sound views of
the conditions of historical testimony. According to what is here
laid down, we are bound to accept as real all the persons mentioned
by Homer, Arktinus, Leschês, the Hesiodic poets, Eumêlus, Asius,
etc., unless we can adduce some positive ground in each particular
case to prove the contrary. If this position be a true one, the
greater part of the history of England, from Brute the Trojan down
to Julius Cæsar, ought at once to be admitted as valid and worthy
of credence. What Mr. Clinton here calls the <i>early tradition</i>,
is in point of fact, the narrative of these early poets. The word
<i>tradition</i> is an equivocal word, and begs the whole question; for
while in its obvious and literal meaning it implies only something
handed down, whether truth or fiction,—it is tacitly understood to
imply a tale descriptive of some real matter of fact, taking its rise
at the time when that fact happened, and originally accurate, but
corrupted by subsequent oral transmission. Understanding, therefore,
by Mr. Clinton’s words <i>early tradition</i>, the tales of the old
poets, we shall find his position totally inadmissible,—that we are
bound to admit the persons or statements of Homer and Hesiod as real
unless where we can produce reasons to the contrary. To allow this,
would be to put them upon a par with good contemporary witnesses;
for no greater privilege can be claimed in favor even of Thucydidês,
than the title of his testimony to be believed unless where it can
be contradicted on special grounds. The presumption in favor of an
asserting witness is either strong or weak, or positively nothing,
according to the compound ratio of his means of knowledge, his moral
and intellectual habits, and his motive to speak the truth. Thus,
for instance, when Hesiod tells us that his father quitted the Æolic
Kymê, and came to Askra in Bœôtia, we may fully believe him; but
when he describes to us the battles between the Olympic gods and the
Titans, or between Hêraklês and Cycnus,—or when Homer depicts the
efforts of Hectôr, aided by Apollo, for the defence of Troy, and the
struggles of Achilles and Odysseus, with the assistance of Hêrê and
Poseidôn, for the destruction of that city, events professedly long
past and gone,—we cannot presume either of them<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span> to be in any way worthy of belief. It
cannot be shown that they possessed any means of knowledge, while
it is certain that they could have no motive to consider historical
truth: their object was to satisfy an uncritical appetite for
narrative, and to interest the emotions of their hearers. Mr. Clinton
says, that “the persons may be considered real when the description
of them is consistent with the state of the country at that time.”
But he has forgotten, first, that we know nothing of the state of the
country except what these very poets tell us; next, that fictitious
persons may be just as consonant to the state of the country as real
persons. While, therefore, on the one hand, we have no independent
evidence either to affirm or to deny that Achilles or Agamemnôn are
consistent with the state of Greece or Asia Minor, at a certain
supposed date 1183 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, so, on the other hand, even
assuming such consistency to be made out, this of itself would not
prove them to be real persons.</p>

<p>Mr. Clinton’s reasoning altogether overlooks the existence of
<i>plausible fiction</i>,—fictitious stories which harmonize perfectly
well with the general course of facts, and which are distinguished
from matters of fact not by any internal character, but by the
circumstance that matter of fact has some competent and well-informed
witness to authenticate it, either directly or through legitimate
inference. Fiction may be, and often is, extravagant and incredible;
but it may also be plausible and specious, and in that case there
is nothing but the want of an attesting certificate to distinguish
it from truth. Now all the tests, which Mr. Clinton proposes as
guarantees of the reality of the Homeric persons, will be just as
well satisfied by plausible fiction as by actual matter of fact:
the plausibility of the fiction consists in its satisfying those
and other similar conditions. In most cases, the tales of the
poets <i>did</i> fall in with the existing current of feelings in their
audience: “prejudice and vanity” are not the only feelings, but
doubtless prejudice and vanity were often appealed to, and it was
from such harmony of sentiment that they acquired their hold on men’s
belief. Without any doubt, the Iliad appealed most powerfully to the
reverence for ancestral gods and heroes among the Asiatic colonists
who first heard it: the temptation of putting forth an interesting
tale is quite a sufficient stimulus to the invention of the poet,
and the plausibility of the tale a suffi<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_52">[p. 52]</span>cient passport to the belief of the
hearers. Mr. Clinton talks of “consistent and general tradition.”
But that the tale of a poet, when once told with effect and beauty,
acquired general belief,—is no proof that it was founded on fact:
otherwise, what are we to say to the divine legends, and to the
large portion of the Homeric narrative which Mr. Clinton himself
sets aside as untrue, under the designation of “poetical ornament?”
When a mythical incident is recorded as “forming the basis” of
some known historical fact or institution,—as, for instance, the
successful stratagem by which Melanthus killed Xanthus, in the
battle on the boundary, as recounted in my last chapter,—we may
adopt one of two views; we may either treat the incident as real,
and as having actually given occasion to what is described as its
effect,—or we may treat the incident as a legend imagined in order
to assign some plausible origin of the reality,—“Aut ex re nomen,
aut ex vocabulo fabula.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78"
class="fnanchor">[78]</a> In cases where the legendary incident is
referred to a time long anterior to any records,—as it commonly
is,—the second mode of proceeding appears to me far more consonant to
reason and probability than the first. It is to be recollected that
all the persons and facts, here defended as matter of real history,
by Mr. Clinton, are referred to an age long preceding the first
beginning of records.</p>

<p>I have already remarked that Mr. Clinton shrinks from his own
rule in treating Kadmus and Danaus as real persons, since they are
as much eponyms of tribes or races as Dôrus and Hellên. And if he
can admit Hêraklês to be a real man, I cannot see upon what reason
he can consistently disallow any one of the mythical personages, for
there is not one whose exploits are more strikingly at variance with
the standard of historical probability. Mr. Clinton reasons upon the
supposition that “Herculês was a <i>Dorian</i> hero:” but he was Achæan
and Kadmeian as well as Dorian, though the legends respecting him are
different in all the three characters. Whether his son Tlepolemus
and his grandson Cleodæus belong to the category of historical men,
I will not take upon me to say, though O. Müller (in my opinion
without any warranty) appears to admit it; but Hyllus certainly
is not a real man, if the canon of Mr. Clinton himself respecting
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span> eponyms is
to be trusted. “The descendants of Herculês (observes Mr. Clinton)
remained in many states down to the historical times.” So did those
of Zeus and Apollo, and of that god whom the historian Hekatæus
recognized as his progenitor in the sixteenth generation; the titular
kings of Ephesus, in the historical times, as well as Peisistratus,
the despot of Athens, traced their origin up to Æolus and Hellên,
yet Mr. Clinton does not hesitate to reject Æolus and Hellên as
fictitious persons. I dispute the propriety of quoting the Iliad and
Odyssey (as Mr. Clinton does) in evidence of the historic personality
of Herculês. For, even with regard to the ordinary men who figure
in those poems, we have no means of discriminating the real from
the fictitious; while the Homeric Hêraklês is unquestionably more
than an ordinary man,—he is the favorite son of Zeus, from his birth
predestined to a life of labor and servitude, as preparation for a
glorious immortality. Without doubt, the poet himself believed in the
reality of Herculês, but it was a reality clothed with superhuman
attributes.</p>

<p>Mr. Clinton observes (Introd. p. ii.), that “because some
genealogies were fictitious, we are not justified in concluding that
all were fabulous.” It is no way necessary that we should maintain
so extensive a position: it is sufficient that all are fabulous so
far as concerns gods and heroes,—<i>some</i> fabulous throughout,—and
none ascertainably true, for the period anterior to the recorded
Olympiads. How much, or what particular portions, may be true, no
one can pronounce. The gods and heroes are, from our point of view,
essentially fictitious; but from the Grecian point of view they were
the most real (if the expression may be permitted, <i>i. e.</i> clung to
with the strongest faith) of all the members of the series. They
not only formed parts of the genealogy as originally conceived,
but were in themselves the grand reason why it was conceived,—as a
golden chain to connect the living man with a divine ancestor. The
genealogy, therefore, taken as a whole, (and its value consists in
its being taken as a whole,) was from the beginning a fiction; but
the names of the father and grandfather of the living man, in whose
day it first came forth, were doubtless those of real men. Wherever,
therefore, we can verify the date of a genealogy, as applied to some
living person, we may reasonably presume the two lowest members
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span> it to be also
those of real persons: but this has no application to the time
anterior to the Olympiads,—still less to the pretended times of the
Trojan war, the Kalydônian boar-hunt, or the deluge of Deukalion. To
reason (as Mr. Clinton does, Introd. p. vi.),—“Because Aristomachus
was a real man, therefore his father Cleodæus, his grandfather
Hyllus, and so farther upwards, etc., must have been real men,”—is
an inadmissible conclusion. The historian Hekatæus was a real man,
and doubtless his father Hegesander, also,—but it would be unsafe to
march up his genealogical ladder fifteen steps, to the presence of
the ancestorial god of whom he boasted: the upper steps of the ladder
will be found broken and unreal. Not to mention that the inference,
from real son to real father, is inconsistent with the admissions
in Mr. Clinton’s own genealogical tables; for he there inserts the
names of several mythical fathers as having begotten real historical
sons.</p>

<p>The general authority of Mr. Clinton’s book, and the sincere
respect which I entertain for his elucidations of the later
chronology, have imposed upon me the duty of assigning those
grounds on which I dissent from his conclusions prior to the first
recorded Olympiad. The reader who desires to see the numerous and
contradictory guesses (they deserve no better name) of the Greeks
themselves in the attempt to chronologize their mythical narratives,
will find them in the copious notes annexed to the first half of
his first volume. As I consider all such researches not merely as
fruitless, in regard to any trustworthy result, but as serving to
divert attention from the genuine form and really illustrative
character of Grecian legend, I have not thought it right to go over
the same ground in the present work. Differing as I do, however, from
Mr. Clinton’s views on this subject, I concur with him in deprecating
the application of etymology (Intr. pp. xi-xii.) as a general scheme
of explanation to the characters and events of Greek legend. Amongst
the many causes which operated as suggestives and stimulants to Greek
fancy in the creation of these interesting tales, doubtless etymology
has had its share; but it cannot be applied (as Hermann, above all
others, has sought to apply it) for the purpose of imparting supposed
sense and system to the general body of mythical narrative. I have
already remarked on this topic in a former chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p. 55]</span>It would
be curious to ascertain at what time, or by whom, the earliest
continuous genealogies, connecting existing persons with the
supposed antecedent age of legend, were formed and preserved.
Neither Homer nor Hesiod mentioned any verifiable <i>present</i> persons
or circumstances: had they done so, the age of one or other of them
could have been determined upon good evidence, which we may fairly
presume to have been impossible, from the endless controversies upon
this topic among ancient writers. In the Hesiodic Works and Days, the
heroes of Troy and Thêbes are even presented as an extinct race,<a
id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
radically different from the poet’s own contemporaries, who are a new
race, far too depraved to be conceived as sprung from the loins of
the heroes; so that we can hardly suppose Hesiod (though his father
was a native of the Æolic Kymê) to have admitted the pedigree of the
Æolic chiefs, as reputed descendants of Agamemnôn. Certain it is,
that the earliest poets did not attempt to measure or bridge over
the supposed interval, between their own age and the war of Troy, by
any definite series of fathers and sons: whether Eumêlus or Asius
made any such attempt, we cannot tell, but the earliest continuous
backward genealogies which we find mentioned are those of Pherekydês,
Hellanikus, and Herodotus. It is well known that Herodotus, in his
manner of computing the upward genealogy of the Spartan kings,
assigns the date of the Trojan war to a period 800 years earlier
than himself, equivalent about to <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 1270-1250;
while the subsequent Alexandrine chronologists, Eratosthenês and
Apollodôrus, place that event in 1184 and 1183 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>;
and the Parian marble refers it to an intermediate date, different
from either,—1209 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Ephorus, Phanias, Timæus,
Kleitarchus, and Duris, had each his own conjectural date; but
the computations of the Alexandrine chronologists was the most
generally followed by those who succeeded them, and seems to have
passed to modern times as the received date of this great legendary
event,—though some distinguished inquirers have adopted the epoch of
Herodotus, which Larcher has attempted to vindicate in an elaborate
but feeble dissertation.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80"
class="fnanchor">[80]</a> It is unnecessary to state that, in my
view, the inquiry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span>
has no other value except to illustrate the ideas which guided the
Greek mind, and to exhibit its progress from the days of Homer to
those of Herodotus. For it argues a considerable mental progress when
men begin to methodize the past, even though they do so on fictitious
principles, being as yet unprovided with those records which alone
could put them on a better course. The Homeric man was satisfied
with feeling, imagining, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[p.
57]</span> believing particular incidents of a supposed past, without
any attempt to graduate the line of connection between them and
himself: to introduce fictitious hypotheses and media of connection
is the business of a succeeding age, when the stimulus of rational
curiosity is first felt, without any authentic materials to supply
it. We have, then, the form of history operating upon the matter
of legend,—the transition-state between legend and history; less
interesting, indeed, than either separately, yet necessary as a step
between the two.</p>

    STATE OF SOCIETY AND MANNERS AS EXHIBITED IN GRECIAN
    LEGEND.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">Though</span> the particular
persons and events, chronicled in the legendary poems of Greece, are
not to be regarded as belonging to the province of real history,
those poems are, nevertheless, full of instruction as pictures of
life and manners; and the very same circumstances, which divest their
composers of all credibility as historians, render them so much the
more valuable as unconscious expositors of their own contemporary
society. While professedly describing an uncertified past, their
combinations are involuntarily borrowed from the surrounding present:
for among communities, such as those of the primitive Greeks, without
books, without means of extended travel, without acquaintance with
foreign languages and habits, the imagination, even of highly gifted
men, was naturally enslaved by the circumstances around them to a
far greater degree than in the later days of Solôn or Herodotus;
insomuch that the characters which they conceived and the scenes
which they described would for that reason bear a stronger generic
resemblance to the realities of their own time and locality. Nor was
the poetry of that age addressed to lettered and critical authors,
watchful to detect plagiarism, sated with<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_58">[p. 58]</span> simple imagery, and requiring something
of novelty or peculiarity in every fresh production. To captivate
their emotions, it was sufficient to depict, with genius and fervor,
the more obvious manifestations of human adventure or suffering, and
to idealize that type of society, both private and public, with which
the hearers around were familiar. Even in describing the gods, where
a great degree of latitude and deviation might have been expected,<a
id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> we see
that Homer introduces into Olympus the passions, the caprices, the
love of power and patronage, the alternation of dignity and weakness,
which animated the bosom of an ordinary Grecian chief; and this
tendency, to reproduce in substance the social relations to which he
had been accustomed, would operate still more powerfully when he had
to describe simply human characters,—the chief and his people, the
warrior and his comrades, the husband, wife, father, and son,—or the
imperfect rudiments of judicial and administrative proceeding. That
his narrative on all these points, even with fictitious characters
and events, presents a close approximation to general reality, there
can be no reason to doubt.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82"
class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The necessity under which he lay of drawing
from a store, then happily unexhausted, of personal experience and
observation, is one of the causes of that freshness and vivacity of
description for which he stands unrivalled, and which constituted the
imperishable charm of the Iliad and Odyssey from the beginning to the
end of Grecian literature.</p>

<p>While, therefore, we renounce the idea of chronologizing or
historicizing the events of Grecian legend, we may turn them to
profit as valuable memorials of that state of society, feeling,
and intelligence, which must be to us the starting-point of the
history of the people. Of course, the legendary age, like all those
which succeeded it, had its antecedent causes and determining
conditions; but of these we know nothing, and we are compelled
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span> assume it as
a primary fact, for the purpose of following out its subsequent
changes. To conceive absolute beginning or origin (as Niebuhr
has justly remarked) is beyond the reach of our faculties: we
can neither apprehend nor verify anything beyond progress, or
development, or decay,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a>—change from one set of circumstances to
another, operated by some definite combination of physical or moral
laws. In the case of the Greeks, the legendary age, as the earliest
in any way known to us, must be taken as the initial state from
which this series of changes commences. We must depict its prominent
characteristics as well as we can, and show,—partly how it serves to
prepare, partly how it forms a contrast to set off,—the subsequent
ages of Solôn, of Periklês, and of Demosthenês.</p>

<p>1. The political condition, which Grecian legend everywhere
presents to us, is in its principal features strikingly different
from that which had become universally prevalent among the Greeks
in the time of the Peloponnêsian war. Historical oligarchy, as
well as democracy, agreed in requiring a certain established
system of government, comprising the three elements of specialized
functions, temporary functionaries, and ultimate responsibility<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p. 60]</span> (under some forms
or other) to the mass of qualified citizens—either a Senate or
an Ecclesia, or both. There were, of course, many and capital
distinctions between one government and another, in respect to the
qualification of the citizen, the attributes and efficiency of the
general assembly, the admissibility to power, etc.; and men might
often be dissatisfied with the way in which these questions were
determined in their own city. But in the mind of every man, some
determining rule or system—something like what in modern times is
called a <i>constitution</i>—was indispensable to any government entitled
to be called legitimate, or capable of creating in the mind of a
Greek a feeling of moral obligation to obey it. The functionaries
who exercised authority under it might be more or less competent
or popular; but his personal feelings towards them were commonly
lost in his attachment or aversion to the general system. If any
energetic man could by audacity or craft break down the constitution,
and render himself permanent ruler according to his own will and
pleasure,—even though he might govern well, he could never inspire
the people with any sentiment of duty towards him. His sceptre was
illegitimate from the beginning, and even the taking of his life,
far from being interdicted by that moral feeling which condemned
the shedding of blood in other cases, was considered meritorious.
Nor could he be mentioned in the language except by a name<a
id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
(τύραννος, <i>despot</i>,) which branded him as an object of mingled fear
and dislike.</p>

<p>If we carry our eyes back from historical to legendary Greece, we
find a picture the reverse of what has been here sketched. We discern
a government in which there is little or no scheme or system,—still
less any idea of responsibility to the governed,—but in which the
mainspring of obedience on the part of the people consists in their
personal feeling and reverence towards the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span> chief. We remark, first and foremost,
the king: next, a limited number of subordinate kings or chiefs;
afterwards, the mass of armed freemen, husbandmen, artisans,
freebooters, etc.; lowest of all, the free laborers for hire, and
the bought slaves. The king is not distinguished by any broad or
impassable boundary from the other chiefs, to each of whom the
title <i>basileus</i> is applicable as well as to himself: his supremacy
has been inherited from his ancestors, and passes by descent, as
a general rule, to his eldest son, having been conferred upon the
family as a privilege by the favor of Zeus.<a id="FNanchor_85"
href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In war, he is the
leader, foremost in personal prowess, and directing all military
movements; in peace, he is the general protector of the injured and
oppressed; he farther offers up those public prayers and sacrifices
which are intended to obtain for the whole people the favor of the
gods. An ample domain is assigned to him as an appurtenance of his
lofty position, while the produce of his fields and his cattle
is consecrated in part to an abundant, though rude hospitality.
Moreover, he receives frequent presents, to avert his enmity,
to conciliate his favor,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86"
class="fnanchor">[86]</a> or to buy off his exactions; and when
plunder is taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span>
from the enemy, a large previous share, comprising probably the
most alluring female captive, is reserved for him, apart from
the general distribution.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87"
class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span>Such is the
position of the king, in the heroic times of Greece,—the only
person (if we except the heralds and priests, each both special
and subordinate,) who is then presented to us as clothed with
any individual authority,—the person by whom all the executive
functions, then few in number, which the society requires, are either
performed or directed. His personal ascendency—derived from divine
countenance, bestowed both upon himself individually and upon his
race, and probably from accredited divine descent—is the salient
feature in the picture. The people hearken to his voice, embrace
his propositions, and obey his orders: not merely resistance, but
even criticism upon his acts, is generally exhibited in an odious
point of view, and is, indeed, never heard of except from some
one or more of the subordinate princes. To keep alive and justify
such feelings in the public mind, however, the king must himself
possess various accomplishments, bodily and mental, and that too
in a superior degree.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He must be brave in the field, wise in the
council, and eloquent in the agora; he must be endued with bodily
strength and activity above other men, and must be an adept, not
only in the use of his arms, but also in those athletic exercises
which the crowd delight to witness. Even the more homely varieties
of manual acquirements are an addition to his character,—such as
the craft of the carpenter or shipwright, the straight furrowing
of the ploughman, or the indefatigable persistence of the mower
without repose or refreshment throughout the longest day.<a
id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p. 64]</span> conditions of
voluntary obedience, during the Grecian heroic times, are family
descent with personal force and superiority mental as well as bodily,
in the chief, coupled with the favor of the gods: an old chief, such
as Pêleus and Laërtes, cannot retain his position.<a id="FNanchor_90"
href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> But, on the other hand,
where these elements of force are present, a good deal of violence,
caprice, and rapacity is tolerated: the ethical judgment is not exact
in scrutinizing the conduct of individuals so preëminently endowed.
As in the case of the gods, the general epithets of <i>good</i>, <i>just</i>,
etc., are applied to them as euphemisms arising from submission and
fear, being not only not suggested, but often pointedly belied,
by their particular acts. These words signify<a id="FNanchor_91"
href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> the man of birth,
wealth, influence, and daring, whose arm is strong to destroy or to
protect, whatever may be the turn of his moral sentiments; while the
opposite epithet, <i>bad</i>, designates the poor, lowly, and weak; from
whose dispositions, be they ever so virtuous, society has little
either to hope or to fear.</p>

<p>Aristotle, in his general theory of government,<a id="FNanchor_92"
href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> lays down the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span> position, that the
earliest sources of obedience and authority among mankind are
personal, exhibiting themselves most perfectly in the type of
paternal supremacy; and that therefore the kingly government, as
most conformable to this stage of social sentiment, became probably
the first established everywhere. And in fact it still continued in
his time to be generally prevalent among the non-Hellenic nations,
immediately around; though the Phœnician cities and Carthage,
the most civilized of all non-Hellenic states, were republics.
Nevertheless, so completely were the feelings about kingship reversed
among his contemporary Greeks, that he finds it difficult to enter
into the voluntary obedience paid by his ancestors to their early
heroic chiefs. He cannot explain to his own satisfaction how any one
man should have been so much superior to the companions around him
as to maintain such immense personal ascendency: he suspects that
in such small communities great merit was very rare, so that the
chief had few competitors.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Such remarks illustrate strongly the
revolution which the Greek mind had undergone during the preceding
centuries, in regard to the internal grounds of political submission.
But the connecting link, between the Homeric and the republican
schemes of government, is to be found in two adjuncts of the Homeric
royalty, which are now to be mentioned,—the boulê, or council of
chiefs, and the agora, or general assembly of freemen.</p>

<p>These two meetings, more or less frequently convoked, and
interwoven with the earliest habits of the primitive Grecian
communities, are exhibited in the monuments of the legendary
age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span> as
opportunities for advising the king, and media for promulgating
his intentions to the people, rather than as restraints upon his
authority. Unquestionably, they must have conduced in practice to the
latter result as well as to the former; but this is not the light in
which the Homeric poems describe them. The chiefs, kings, princes,
or gerontes—for the same word in Greek designates both an old man
and a man of conspicuous rank and position—compose the council,<a
id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> in
which, according to the representations in the Iliad, the resolutions
of Agamemnôn on the one side, and of Hectôr on the other, appear
uniformly to prevail. The harshness and even contempt with which
Hectôr treats respectful opposition from his ancient companion
Polydamas,—the desponding tone and conscious inferiority of the
latter, and the unanimous assent which the former obtains, even when
quite in the wrong—all this is clearly set forth in the poem:<a
id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
while in the Grecian camp we see Nestôr tendering his advice in the
most submissive and delicate manner to Agamemnôn, to be adopted or
rejected, as “the king of men” might determine.<a id="FNanchor_96"
href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The council is
a purely consultative body, assembled, not with any power of
peremptorily arresting mischievous resolves of the king, but solely
for his information and guidance. He himself is the presiding
(boulephŏrus, or) member<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97"
class="fnanchor">[97]</a> of council; the rest, collectively as well
as individually, are his subordinates.</p>

<p>We proceed from the council to the agora: according to what
seems the received custom, the king, after having talked over his
intentions with the former, proceeds to announce them to the people.
The heralds make the crowd sit down in order,<a id="FNanchor_98"
href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span> enforce silence: any
one of the chiefs or councillors—but as it seems, no one else<a
id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>—is
allowed to address them: the king first promulgates his intentions,
which are then open to be commented upon by others. But in the
Homeric agora, no division of affirmative or negative voices ever
takes place, nor is any formal resolution ever adopted. The nullity
of positive function strikes us even more in the agora than in the
council. It is an assembly for talk, communication, and discussion,
to a certain extent, by the chiefs, in presence of the people as
listeners and sympathizers,—often for eloquence, and sometimes for
quarrel,—but here its ostensible purposes end.</p>

<p>The agora in Ithaka, in the second book of the Odyssey, is
convened by the youthful Telemachus, at the instigation of Athênê,
not for the purpose of submitting any proposition, but in order to
give formal and public notice to the suitors to desist from their
iniquitous intrusion and pillage of his substance, and to absolve
himself farther, before gods and men, from all obligations towards
them, if they refuse to comply. For the slaughter of the suitors, in
all the security of the festive hall and banquet (which forms the
catastrophe of the Odyssey), was a proceeding involving much that was
shocking to Grecian feeling,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100"
class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and therefore required to be preceded
by such ample formalities, as would leave both the delinquents
themselves without the shadow of excuse, and their surviving
relatives without any claim to the customary satisfaction. For this
special purpose, Telemachus directs the heralds to summon an agora:
but what seems most of all sur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p.
68]</span>prising is, that none had ever been summoned or held
since the departure of Odysseus himself,—an interval of twenty
years. “No agora or session has taken place amongst us (says the
gray-headed Ægyptius, who opens the proceedings) since Odysseus
went on shipboard: and now, who is he that has called us together?
what man, young or old, has felt such a strong necessity? Has he
received intelligence from our absent warriors, or has he other
public news to communicate? He is our good friend for doing this:
whatever his projects may be, I pray Zeus to grant him success.”<a
id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
Telemachus, answering the appeal forthwith, proceeds to tell the
assembled Ithakans that he has no public news to communicate, but
that he has convoked them upon his own private necessities. Next, he
sets forth, pathetically, the wickedness of the suitors, calls upon
them personally to desist, and upon the people to restrain them,
and concludes by solemnly warning them, that, being henceforward
free from all obligation towards them, he will invoke the avenging
aid of Zeus, so “that they may be slain in the interior of his
own house, without bringing upon him any subsequent penalty.”<a
id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>We are not of course to construe the Homeric description as
anything more than an <i>idéal</i>, approximating to actual reality.
But, allowing all that can be required for such a limitation,
it exhibits the agora more as a special medium of publicity and
intercommunication,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103"
class="fnanchor">[103]</a> from the king to the body of the people,
than as including any idea of responsibility on the part of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span> former or restraining
force on the part of the latter, however such consequences may
indirectly grow out of it. The primitive Grecian government is
essentially monarchical, reposing on personal feeling and divine
right: the memorable dictum in the Iliad is borne out by all that
we hear of the actual practice; “The ruler of many is not a good
thing: let us have one ruler only,—one king,—him to whom Zeus has
given the sceptre and the tutelary sanctions.”<a id="FNanchor_104"
href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The second book of the Iliad, full as it is of beauty and
vivacity, not only confirms our idea of the passive, recipient, and
listening character of the agora, but even presents a repulsive
picture of the degradation of the mass of the people before the
chiefs. Agamemnôn convokes the agora for the purpose of immediately
arming the Grecian host, under a full impression that the gods have
at last determined forthwith to crown his arms with complete victory.
Such impression has been created by a special visit of Oneirus
(the Dream-god), sent by Zeus during his sleep,—being, indeed, an
intentional fraud on the part of Zeus, though Agamemnôn does not
suspect its deceitful character. At this precise moment, when he
may be conceived to be more than usually anxious to get his army
into the field and snatch the prize, an unaccountable fancy seizes
him, that, instead of inviting the troops to do what he really
wishes, and encouraging their spirits for this one last effort, he
will adopt a course directly contrary: he will try their courage
by professing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span> to
believe that the siege had become desperate, and that there was no
choice except to go on shipboard and flee. Announcing to Nestôr
and Odysseus, in preliminary council, his intention to hold this
strange language, he at the same time tells them that he relies upon
them to oppose it and counterwork its effect upon the multitude.<a
id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
The agora is presently assembled, and the king of men pours forth
a speech full of dismay and despair, concluding by a distinct
exhortation to all present to go aboard and return home at once.
Immediately the whole army, chiefs as well as people, break up and
proceed to execute his orders: every one rushes off to get his
ship afloat, except Odysseus, who looks on in mournful silence
and astonishment. The army would have been quickly on its voyage
home, had not the goddesses Hêrê and Athênê stimulated Odysseus
to an instantaneous interference. He hastens among the dispersing
crowd and diverts them from their purpose of retreat: to the chiefs
he addresses flattering words, trying to shame them by gentle
expostulation: but the people he visits with harsh reprimand and
blows from his sceptre,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106"
class="fnanchor">[106]</a> thus driving them back to their seats in
the agora.</p>

<p>Amidst the dissatisfied crowd thus unwillingly brought back, the
voice of Thersitês is heard the longest and the loudest,—a man ugly,
deformed, and unwarlike, but fluent in speech, and especially severe
and unsparing in his censure of the chiefs, Agamemnôn, Achilles, and
Odysseus. Upon this occasion, he addresses to the people a speech
denouncing Agamemnôn for selfish and greedy exaction generally,
but particularly for his recent ill-treatment of Achilles,—and he
endeavors, moreover, to induce them to persist in their scheme of
departure. In reply, Odysseus not only rebukes Thersitês sharply
for his impudence in abusing the commander-in-chief, but threatens
that, if ever such behavior is repeated, he will strip him naked,
and thrash him out of the assembly with disgraceful blows; as an
earnest of which, he administers to him at once a smart stroke
with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span> studded
sceptre, imprinting its painful mark in a bloody weal across his
back. Thersitês, terrified and subdued, sits down weeping; while the
surrounding crowd deride him, and express the warmest approbation
of Odysseus for having thus by force put the reviler to silence.<a
id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>Both Odysseus and Nestôr then address the agora, sympathizing
with Agamemnôn for the shame which the retreat of the Greeks is
about to inflict upon him, and urging emphatically upon every one
present the obligation of persevering until the siege shall be
successfully consummated. Neither of them animadverts at all upon
Agamemnôn, either for his conduct towards Achilles, or for his
childish freak of trying the temper of the army.<a id="FNanchor_108"
href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>There cannot be a clearer indication than this description—so
graphic in the original poem—of the true character of the Homeric
agora. The multitude who compose it are listening and acquiescent,
not often hesitating, and never refractory<a id="FNanchor_109"
href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> to the chief. The
fate which awaits a presumptuous critic, even where his virulent
reproaches are substantially well-founded, is plainly set forth
in the treatment of Thersitês; while the unpopularity of such a
character is attested even more by the excessive pains which Homer
takes to heap upon him repulsive personal deformities, than by
the chastisement of Odysseus;—he is lame, bald, crook-backed, of
misshapen head, and squinting vision.</p>

<p>But we cease to wonder at the submissive character of the
agora, when we read the proceedings of Odysseus towards the people
themselves;—his fine words and flattery addressed to the chiefs, and
his contemptuous reproof and manual violence towards the common men,
at a moment when both were doing exactly the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span> same thing,—fulfilling the express
bidding of Agamemnôn, upon whom Odysseus does not offer a single
comment. This scene, which excited a sentiment of strong displeasure
among the democrats of historical Athens,<a id="FNanchor_110"
href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> affords a proof that
the feeling of personal dignity, of which philosophic observers in
Greece—Herodotus, Xenophôn, Hippocratês, and Aristotle—boasted, as
distinguishing the free Greek citizen from the slavish Asiatic,
was yet undeveloped in the time of Homer.<a id="FNanchor_111"
href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The ancient epic is
commonly so filled with the personal adventures of the chiefs, and
the people are so constantly depicted as simple appendages attached
to them, that we rarely obtain a glimpse of the treatment of the
one apart from the other, such as this memorable Homeric agora
affords.</p>

<p>There remains one other point of view in which we are to regard
the agora of primitive Greece,—as the scene in which justice was
administered. The king is spoken of as constituted by Zeus the great
judge of society: he has received from Zeus the sceptre, and along
with it the powers of command and sanction: the people obey these
commands and enforce these sanctions, under him, enriching him at the
same time with lucrative presents and payments.<a id="FNanchor_112"
href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Sometimes the king
separately, sometimes the kings or chiefs or gerontes in the plural
number, are named as deciding disputes and awarding satisfaction
to complainants; always, however, in public, in the midst of
the assembled agora.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113"
class="fnanchor">[113]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p.
73]</span> In one of the compartments of the shield of Achilles, the
details of a judicial scene are described. While the agora is full of
an eager and excited crowd, two men are disputing about the fine of
satisfaction for the death of a murdered man,—one averring, the other
denying, that the fine had already been paid, and both demanding an
inquest. The gerontes are ranged on stone seats,<a id="FNanchor_114"
href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> in the holy circle,
with two talents of gold lying before them, to be awarded to such
of the litigants as shall make out his case to their satisfaction.
The heralds with their sceptres, repressing the warm sympathies
of the crowd in favor of one or other of the parties, secure an
alternate hearing to both.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115"
class="fnanchor">[115]</a> This interesting picture completely
harmonizes with the brief allusion of Hesiod to the judicial
trial—doubtless a real trial—between himself and his brother Persês.
The two brothers disputed about their paternal inheritance, and
the cause was carried to be tried by the chiefs in agora; but
Persês bribed them, and obtained an unjust verdict for the whole.<a
id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> So
at least Hesiod affirms, in the bitterness of his heart; earnestly
exhorting his brother not to waste a precious time, required for
necessary labors, in the unprofitable occupation of witnessing and
abetting litigants in the agora,—for which (he adds) no man has
proper leisure, unless his subsistence for the year beforehand
be safely treasured up in his garners.<a id="FNanchor_117"
href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> He repeats, more than
once, his complaints of the crooked and corrupt judgments of which
the kings were habitually guilty; dwelling upon abuse of justice
as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span> the crying evil
of his day, and predicting as well as invoking the vengeance of
Zeus to repress it. And Homer ascribes the tremendous violence of
the autumnal storms to the wrath of Zeus against those judges who
disgrace the agora with their wicked verdicts.<a id="FNanchor_118"
href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Though it is certain that, in every state of society, the feelings
of men when assembled in multitude will command a certain measure of
attention, yet we thus find the agora, in judicial matters still more
than in political, serving merely the purpose of publicity. It is the
king who is the grand personal mover of Grecian heroic society.<a
id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> He
is on earth, the equivalent of Zeus in the agora of the gods: the
supreme god of Olympus is in the habit of carrying on his government
with frequent publicity, of hearing some dissentient opinions, and of
allowing himself occasionally to be wheedled by Aphroditê, or worried
into compliance by Hêrê: but his determination is at last conclusive,
subject only to the overruling interference of the Mœræ, or Fates.<a
id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Both the society of gods, and the various societies of men, are,
according to the conceptions of Grecian legend, carried on by the
personal rule of a legitimate sovereign, who does not derive his
title from the special appointment of his subjects, though he governs
with their full consent. In fact, Grecian legend presents to us
hardly anything else, except these great individual personalities.
The race, or nation, is as it were absorbed into the prince:
eponymous persons, especially, are not merely princes, but fathers
and representative unities, each the equivalent of that greater or
less aggregate to which he gives name.</p>

<p>But though, in the primitive Grecian government, the king is the
legitimate as well as the real sovereign, he is always conceived as
acting through the council and agora. Both the one and the other
are established and essential media through which his ascendency is
brought to bear upon the society: the absence of such assemblies is
the test and mark of savage men, as in the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span> case of the Cyclôpes.<a id="FNanchor_121"
href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Accordingly, he must
possess qualities fit to act with effect upon these two assemblies:
wise reason for the council, unctuous eloquence for the agora.<a
id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
Such is the <i>idéal</i> of the heroic government: a king, not merely full
of valor and resource as a soldier, but also sufficiently superior
to those around him to insure both the deliberate concurrence of the
chiefs, and the hearty adhesion of the masses.<a id="FNanchor_123"
href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> That this picture is
not, in all individual cases, realized, is unquestionable; but the
endowments so often predicated of good kings show it to have been
the type present to the mind of the describer.<a id="FNanchor_124"
href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Xenophôn, in his
Cyropædia, depicts Cyrus as an improved edition of the Homeric
Agamemnôn,—“a good king and a powerful soldier,” thus idealizing the
perfection of personal government.</p>

<p>It is important to point out these fundamental conceptions of
government, discernible even before the dawn of Grecian history,
and identified with the social life of the people. It shows us
that the Greeks, in their subsequent revolutions, and in the
political experiments which their countless autonomous commu<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p. 76]</span>nities presented, worked
upon preëxisting materials,—developing and exalting elements which
had been at first subordinate, and suppressing, or remodelling on a
totally new principle, that which had been originally predominant.
When we approach historical Greece, we find that (with the exception
of Sparta) the primitive hereditary, unresponsible monarch,
uniting in himself all the functions of government, has ceased to
reign,—while the feeling of legitimacy, which originally induced his
people to obey him willingly, has been exchanged for one of aversion
towards the character and title generally. The multifarious functions
which he once exercised, have been parcelled out among temporary
nominees. On the other hand, the council, or senate, and the agora,
originally simple media through which the king acted, are elevated
into standing and independent sources of authority, controlling
and holding in responsibility the various special officers to whom
executive duties of one kind or another are confided. The general
principle here indicated is common both to the oligarchies and
the democracies which grew up in historical Greece: much as these
two governments differed from each other, and many as were the
varieties even between one oligarchy or democracy and another,
they all stood in equal contrast with the principle of the heroic
government. Even in Sparta, where the hereditary kingship lasted, it
was preserved with lustre and influence exceedingly diminished,<a
id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
and such timely diminution of its power seems to have been one of
the essential conditions of its preservation.<a id="FNanchor_126"
href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Though the Spartan
kings had the hereditary command of the military forces, yet,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span> even in all foreign
expeditions, they habitually acted in obedience to orders from home;
while in affairs of the interior, the superior power of the ephors
sensibly overshadowed them. So that, unless possessed of more than
ordinary force of character, they seem to have exercised their chief
influence as presiding members of the senate.</p>

<p>There is yet another point of view in which it behoves us to take
notice of the council and the agora as integral portions of the
legendary government of the Grecian communities. We are thus enabled
to trace the employment of public speaking, as the standing engine
of government and the proximate cause of obedience, to the social
infancy of the nation. The power of speech in the direction of public
affairs becomes more and more obvious, developed, and irresistible,
as we advance towards the culminating period of Grecian history, the
century preceding the battle of Chæroneia. That its development was
greatest among the most enlightened sections of the Grecian name, and
smallest among the more obtuse and stationary, is matter of notorious
fact; nor is it less true, that the prevalence of this habit was
one of the chief causes of the intellectual eminence of the nation
generally. At a time when all the countries around were plunged
comparatively in mental torpor, there was no motive sufficiently
present and powerful to multiply so wonderfully the productive minds
of Greece, except such as arose from the rewards of public speaking.
The susceptibility of the multitude to this sort of guidance, their
habit of requiring and enjoying the stimulus which it supplied, and
the open discussion, combining regular forms with free opposition,
of practical matters, political as well as judicial,—are the
creative causes which formed such conspicuous adepts in the art of
persuasion. Nor was it only professed orators who were thus produced;
didactic aptitude was formed in the background, and the speculative
tendencies were supplied with interesting phenomena for observation
and combination, at a time when the truths of physical science were
almost inaccessible. If the primary effect was to quicken the powers
of expression, the secondary, but not less certain result, was to
develop the habits of scientific thought. Not only the oratory of
Demosthenês and Periklês, and the colloquial magic of Socratês, but
also the philosophical speculations of Plato, and the syste<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span>matic politics, rhetoric,
and logic of Aristotle, are traceable to the same general tendencies
in the minds of the Grecian people: and we find the germ of these
expansive forces in the senate and agora of their legendary
government. The poets, first epic and then lyric, were the precursors
of the orators, in their power of moving the feelings of an assembled
crowd; whilst the Homeric poems—the general training-book of educated
Greeks—constituted a treasury of direct and animated expression, full
of concrete forms, and rare in the use of abstractions, and thence
better suited to the workings of oratory. The subsequent critics had
no difficulty in selecting from the Iliad and Odyssey, samples of
eloquence in all its phases and varieties.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, the society depicted in the old Greek poems
is loose and unsettled, presenting very little of legal restraint,
and still less of legal protection,—but concentrating such political
power as does exist in the hands of a legitimate hereditary king,
whose ascendency over the other chiefs is more or less complete
according to his personal force and character. Whether that
ascendency be greater or less, however, the mass of the people is
in either case politically passive and of little account. Though
the Grecian freeman of the heroic age is above the degraded level
of the Gallic <i>plebs</i>, as described by Cæsar,<a id="FNanchor_127"
href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> he is far from
rivalling the fierce independence and sense of dignity, combined with
individual force, which characterize the Germanic tribes before their
establishment in the Roman empire. Still less does his condition,
or the society in which he moves, correspond to those pleasing
dreams of spontaneous rectitude and innocence, in which Tacitus and
Seneca indulge with regard to primitive man.<a id="FNanchor_128"
href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span>2. The state of
moral and social feeling, prevalent in legendary Greece, exhibits
a scene in harmony with the rudimentary political fabrics just
described. Throughout the long stream of legendary narrative on which
the Greeks looked back as their past history, the larger social
motives hardly ever come into play: either individual valor and
cruelty, or the personal attachments and quarrels of relatives and
war-companions, or the feuds of private enemies, are ever before us.
There is no sense of obligation then existing, between man and man as
such,—and very little between each man and the entire community of
which he is a member; such sentiments are neither operative in the
real world, nor present to the imaginations of the poets. Personal
feelings, either towards the gods, the king, or some near and known
individual, fill the whole of a man’s bosom: out of them arise all
the motives to beneficence, and all the internal restraints upon
violence, antipathy, or rapacity: and special communion, as well as
special solemnities, are essential to their existence. The ceremony
of an oath, so imposing, so paramount, and so indispensable in
those days, illustrates strikingly this principle. And even in the
case of the stranger suppliant,—in which an apparently spontaneous
sympathy manifests itself,—the succor and kindness shown to him arise
mainly from his having gone through the consecrated formalities
of supplication, such as that of sitting down in the ashes by the
sacred hearth, thus obtaining a sort of privilege of sanctuary.<a
id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
That ceremony exalts him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p.
80]</span> into something more than a mere suffering man,—it places
him in express fellowship with the master of the house, under the
tutelary sanctions of Zeus Hiketêsios. There is great difference
between one form of supplication and another; the suppliant, however,
in any form, becomes more or less the object of a particular
sympathy.</p>

<p>The sense of obligation towards the gods manifests itself
separately in habitual acts of worship, sacrifice, and libations,
or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span> by votive
presents, such as that of the hair of Achilles, which he has pledged
to the river-god Spercheius,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130"
class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and such as the constant dedicated
offerings which men who stand in urgent need of the divine aid first
promise and afterwards fulfil. But the feeling towards the gods
also appears, and that not less frequently, as mingling itself with
and enforcing obligations towards some particular human person. The
tie which binds a man to his father, his kinsman, his guest, or any
special promisee towards whom he has taken the engagement of an
oath, is conceived in conjunction with the idea of Zeus, as witness
and guarantee; and the intimacy of the association is attested by
some surname or special appellation of the god.<a id="FNanchor_131"
href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Such personal
feelings composed all the moral influences of which a Greek of that
day was susceptible,—a state of mind which we can best appreciate
by contrasting it with that of the subsequent citizen of historical
Athens. In the view of the latter, the great impersonal authority,
called “The Laws,” stood out separately, both as guide and sanction,
distinct from religious duty or private sympathies: but of this
discriminated conception of positive law and positive morality,<a
id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
the germ only can be detected in the Homeric poems. The
appropriate Greek word for human laws never occurs. Amidst a very
wavering phraseology,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133"
class="fnanchor">[133]</a> we can detect a gradual transition<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span> from the primitive
idea of a personal goddess Themis, attached to Zeus, first to his
sentences or orders called Themistes, and next by a still farther
remove to various established customs, which those sentences were
believed to sanctify,—the authority of religion and that of custom
coalescing into one indivisible obligation.</p>

<p>The family relations, as we might expect, are set forth in our
pictures of the legendary world as the grand sources of lasting union
and devoted attachment. The paternal authority is highly reverenced:
the son who lives to years of maturity, repays by affection to
his parents the charge of his maintenance in infancy, which the
language notes by a special word; whilst on the other hand, the
Erinnys, whose avenging hand is put in motion by the curse of a
father or mother, is an object of deep dread.<a id="FNanchor_134"
href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span></p> <p>In regard to
marriage, we find the wife occupying a station of great dignity and
influence, though it was the practice for the husband to purchase her
by valuable presents to her parents,—a practice extensively prevalent
among early communities, and treated by Aristotle as an evidence of
barbarism. She even seems to live less secluded and to enjoy a wider
sphere of action than was allotted to her in historical Greece.<a
id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Concubines are frequent with the chiefs, and occasionally the
jealousy of the wife breaks out in reckless excess against her
husband, as may be seen in the tragical history of Phœnix. The
continence of Laërtês, from fear of displeasing his wife Antikleia,
is especially noticed.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136"
class="fnanchor">[136]</a> A large portion of the romantic interest
which Grecian legend inspires is derived from the women: Penelopê,
Androma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span>chê, Helen,
Klytæmnêstra, Eriphylê, Iokasta, Hekabê, etc., all stand in the
foreground of the picture, either from their virtues, their beauty,
their crimes, or their sufferings.</p>

<p>Not only brothers, but also cousins, and the more distant
blood-relations and clansmen, appear connected together by a strong
feeling of attachment, sharing among them universally the obligation
of mutual self-defence and revenge, in the event of injury to any
individual of the race. The legitimate brothers divide between
them by lot the paternal inheritance,—a bastard brother receiving
only a small share; he is, however, commonly very well treated,<a
id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
though the murder of Phokus, by Telamon and Pêleus, constitutes a
flagrant exception. The furtive pregnancy of young women, often by
a god, is one of the most frequently recurring incidents in the
legendary narratives; and the severity with which such a fact, when
discovered, is visited by the father, is generally extreme. As
an extension of the family connection, we read of larger unions,
called the phratry and the tribe, which are respectfully, but not
frequently, mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138"
class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>The generous readiness with which hospitality is afforded to the
stranger who asks for it,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139"
class="fnanchor">[139]</a> the facility with which he is allowed
to contract the peculiar connection of guest with his host, and
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span> permanence
with which that connection, when created by partaking of the same
food and exchanging presents, is maintained even through a long
period of separation, and even transmitted from father to son—these
are among the most captivating features of the heroic society. The
Homeric chief welcomes the stranger who comes to ask shelter in his
house, first gives him refreshment, and then inquires his name and
the purpose of his voyage.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140"
class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Though not inclined to invite strangers
to his house, he cannot repel them when they spontaneously enter
it craving a lodging.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141"
class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The suppliant is also commonly a stranger,
but a stranger under peculiar circumstances; who proclaims his own
calamitous and abject condition, and seeks to place himself in a
relation to the chief whom he solicits, something like that in
which men stand to the gods. Onerous as such special tie may become
to him, the chief cannot decline it, if solicited in the proper
form: the ceremony of supplication has a binding effect, and the
Erinnys punish the hardhearted person who disallows it. A conquered
enemy may sometimes throw himself at the feet of his conqueror, and
solicit mercy, but he cannot by doing so acquire the character and
claims of a suppliant properly so called: the conqueror has free
discretion either to kill him, or to spare him and accept a ransom.<a
id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>There are in the legendary narratives abundant examples of
individuals who transgress in particular acts even the holiest
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span> these personal
ties, but the savage Cyclops is the only person described as
professedly indifferent to them, and careless of that sanction
of the gods which in Grecian belief accompanied them all.<a
id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
In fact, the tragical horror which pervades the lineage of Athamas
or Kadmus, and which attaches to many of the acts of Hêraklês, of
Pêleus and Telamon, of Jasôn and Mêdea, of Atreus and Thyestês,
etc., is founded upon a deep feeling and sympathy with those special
obligations, which conspicuous individuals, under the temporary
stimulus of the maddening Atê, are driven to violate. In such
conflict of sentiments, between the obligation generally reverenced
and the exceptional deviation in an individual otherwise admired,
consists the pathos of the story.</p>

<p>These feelings—of mutual devotion between kinsmen and companions
in arms—of generous hospitality to the stranger, and of helping
protection to the suppliant,—constitute the bright spots in a dark
age. We find them very generally prevalent amongst communities
essentially rude and barbarous,—amongst the ancient Germans as
described by Tacitus, the Druses in Lebanon,<a id="FNanchor_144"
href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> the Arabian
tribes in the desert, and even the North American Indians.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p. 87]</span></p> <p>They
are the instinctive manifestations of human sociality, standing
at first alone, and for that reason appearing to possess a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span> greater tutelary force
than really belongs to them,—beneficent, indeed, in a high degree,
with reference to their own appropriate period, but serving as a
very imperfect compensation for the impotence of the magistrate,
and for the absence of any all-pervading sympathy or sense of
obligation between man and man. We best appreciate their importance
when we compare the Homeric society with that of barbarians like
the Thracians, who tattooed their bodies, as the mark of a generous
lineage,—sold their children for export as slaves,—considered
robbery, not merely as one admissible occupation among others,
but as the only honorable mode of life; agriculture being held
contemptible,—and above all, delighted in the shedding of blood
as a luxury. Such were the Thracians in the days of Herodotus and
Thucydidês: and the Homeric society forms a mean term between that
which these two historians yet saw in Thrace, and that which they
witnessed among their own civilized countrymen.<a id="FNanchor_145"
href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span></p> <p>When, however,
among the Homeric men we pass beyond the influence of the private
ties above enumerated, we find scarcely any other moralizing
forces in operation. The acts and adventures commemorated imply
a community wherein neither the protection nor the restraints of
law are practically felt, and wherein ferocity, rapine, and the
aggressive propensities generally, seem restrained by no internal
counterbalancing scruples. Homicide, especially, is of frequent
occurrence, sometimes by open violence, sometimes by fraud:
expatriation for homicide is among the most constantly recurring acts
of the Homeric poems: and savage brutalities are often ascribed,
even to admired heroes, with apparent indifference. Achilles
sacrifices twelve Trojan prisoners on the tomb of Patroklus, while
his son Neoptolemus not only slaughters the aged Priam, but also
seizes by the leg the child Astyanax (son of the slain Hector) and
hurls him from one of the lofty towers of Troy.<a id="FNanchor_146"
href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Moreover, the
celebrity of Autolykus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, in
the career of wholesale robbery and perjury, and the wealth which
it enabled him to acquire, are described with the same unaffected
admiration as the wisdom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p.
90]</span> of Nestôr or the strength of Ajax.<a id="FNanchor_147"
href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Achilles, Menelaus,
Odysseus, pillage in person, wherever they can find an opportunity,
employing both force and stratagem to surmount resistance.<a
id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The
vocation of a pirate is recognized and honorable, so that a host,
when he asks his guest what is the purpose of his voyage, enumerates
enrichment by indiscriminate maritime plunder as among those projects
which may naturally enter into his contemplation.<a id="FNanchor_149"
href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Abduction of
cattle, and expeditions for unprovoked ravage as well as for
retaliation, between neighboring tribes, appear ordinary phenomena;<a
id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
and the established inviolability of heralds seems the only evidence
of any settled feeling of obligation between one community and
another. While the house and property of Odysseus, during his long
absence, enjoys no public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[p.
91]</span> protection,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151"
class="fnanchor">[151]</a> those unprincipled chiefs, who consume his
substance, find sympathy rather than disapprobation among the people
of Ithaka. As a general rule, he who cannot protect himself finds no
protection from society: his own kinsmen and immediate companions are
the only parties to whom he can look with confidence for support.
And in this respect, the representation given by Hesiod makes the
picture even worse. In his emphatic denunciation of the fifth age,
that poet deplores not only the absence of all social justice
and sense of obligation among his contemporaries, but also the
relaxation of the ties of family and hospitality.<a id="FNanchor_152"
href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> There are marks
of querulous exaggeration in the poem of the Works and Days; yet
the author professes to describe the real state of things around
him, and the features of his picture, soften them as we may, will
still appear dark and calamitous. It is, however, to be remarked,
that he contemplates a state of peace,—thus forming a contrast with
the Homeric poems. His copious catalogue of social evils scarcely
mentions liability to plunder by a foreign enemy, nor does he compute
the chances of predatory aggression as a source of profit.</p>

<p>There are two special veins of estimable sentiment, on which it
may be interesting to contrast heroic and historical Greece, and
which exhibit the latter as an improvement on the former, not less in
the affections than in the intellect.</p>

<p>The law of Athens was peculiarly watchful and provident with
respect both to the persons and the property of orphan minors;
but the description given in the Iliad of the utter and hopeless
destitution of the orphan boy, despoiled of his paternal inheritance,
and abandoned by all the friends of his father, whom he urgently
supplicates, and who all harshly cast him off, is one of the
most pathetic morsels in the whole poem.<a id="FNanchor_153"
href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> In reference<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span> again to the treatment
of the dead body of an enemy we find all the Greek chiefs who come
near (not to mention the conduct of Achilles himself) piercing with
their spears the corpse of the slain Hectôr, while some of them
even pass disgusting taunts upon it. We may add, from the lost
epics, the mutilation of the dead bodies of Paris and Deiphobus
by the hand of Menelaus.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154"
class="fnanchor">[154]</a> But at the time of the Persian invasion,
it was regarded as unworthy of a right-minded Greek to maltreat in
any way the dead body of an enemy, even where such a deed might
seem to be justified on the plea of retaliation. After the battle
of Platæa, a proposition was made to the Spartan king Pausanias,
to retaliate upon the dead body of Mardonius the indignities which
Xerxês had heaped upon that of Leonidas at Thermopylæ. He indignantly
spurned the suggestion, not without a severe rebuke, or rather a
half-suppressed menace, towards the proposer: and the feeling of
Herodotus himself goes heartily along with him.<a id="FNanchor_155"
href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>The different manner of dealing with homicide presents a
third test, perhaps more striking yet, of the change in Grecian
feelings and manners during the three centuries preceding the
Persian invasion. That which the murderer in the Homeric times
had to dread, was, not public prosecution and punishment, but the
personal vengeance of the kinsmen and friends of the deceased, who
were stimulated by the keenest impulses of honor and obligation to
avenge the deed, and were considered by the public as specially
privileged to do so.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156"
class="fnanchor">[156]</a> To escape from this danger, he<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span> is obliged to flee the
country, unless he can prevail upon the incensed kinsmen to accept of
a valuable payment (we must not speak of coined money, in the days
of Homer) as satisfaction for their slain comrade. They may, if they
please, decline the offer, and persist in their right of revenge;
but if they accept, they are bound to leave the offender unmolested,
and he accordingly remains at home without farther consequences. The
chiefs in agora do not seem to interfere, except to insure payment of
the stipulated sum.</p>

<p>Here we recognize once more the characteristic attribute of the
Grecian heroic age,—the omnipotence of private force, tempered and
guided by family sympathies, and the practical nullity of that
collective sovereign afterwards called <i>The City</i>,—who in historical
Greece becomes the central and paramount source of obligation, but
who appears yet only in the background, as a germ of promise for the
future. And the manner in which, in the case of homicide, that germ
was developed into a powerful reality, presents an interesting field
of comparison with other nations.</p>

<p>For the practice, here designated, of leaving the party guilty
of homicide to compromise by valuable payment with the relatives
of the deceased, and also of allowing to the latter a free choice
whether they would accept such compromise or enforce their right
of personal revenge,—has been remarked in many rude communities,
but is particularly memorable among the early German tribes.<a
id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
Among the many separate Teutonic establish<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span>ments which rose upon the ruins of
the Western Empire of Rome, the right as well as duty of private
revenge, for personal injury or insult offered to any member of a
family,—and the endeavor to avert its effects by means of a pecuniary
composition levied upon the offender, chiefly as satisfaction to
the party injured, but partly also as perquisite to the king,—was
adopted as the basis of their legislation. This fundamental idea was
worked out in elaborate detail as to the valuation of the injury
inflicted, wherein one main circumstance was the rank, condition,
and power of the sufferer. The object of the legislator was to
preserve the society from standing feuds, but at the same time to
accord such full satisfaction as would induce the injured person to
waive his acknowledged right of personal revenge,—the full luxury of
which, as it presented itself to the mind of an Homeric Greek, may
be read in more than one passage of the Iliad.<a id="FNanchor_158"
href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The Ger<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span>man codes begin by trying
to bring about the acceptance of a fixed pecuniary composition as a
constant voluntary custom, and proceed ultimately to enforce it as
a peremptory necessity: the idea of society is at first altogether
subordinate, and its influence passes only by slow degrees from
amicable arbitration into imperative control.</p>

<p>The Homeric society, in regard to this capital point in
human progression, is on a level with that of the German tribes
as described by Tacitus. But the subsequent course of Grecian
legislation takes a direction completely different from that of
the German codes: the primitive and acknowledged right of private
revenge (unless where bought off by pecuniary payment), instead
of being developed into practical working, is superseded by more
comprehensive views of a public wrong requiring public intervention,
or by religious fears respecting the posthumous wrath of the
murdered person. In historical Athens, this right of private revenge
was discountenanced and put out of sight, even so early as the
Drakonian legislation,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159"
class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and at last restricted to a few ex<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p. 96]</span>treme and special cases;
while the murderer came to be considered, first as having sinned
against the gods, next as having deeply injured the society, and
thus at once as requiring absolution and deserving punishment.
On the first of these two grounds, he is interdicted from the
agora and from all holy places, as well as from public functions,
even while yet untried and simply a suspected person; for if this
were not done, the wrath of the gods would manifest itself in bad
crops and other national calamities. On the second ground, he is
tried before the council of Areiopagus, and if found guilty, is
condemned to death, or perhaps to disfranchisement and banishment.<a
id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The
idea of a propitiatory payment to the relatives of the deceased has
ceased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span> altogether
to be admitted: it is the protection of society which dictates,
and the force of society which inflicts, a measure of punishment
calculated to deter for the future.</p>

<p>3. The society of legendary Greece includes, besides the
chiefs, the general mass of freemen (λαοί), among whom stand out
by special names certain professional men, such as the carpenter,
the smith, the leather-dresser, the leech, the prophet, the bard,
and the fisherman.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161"
class="fnanchor">[161]</a> We have no means of appreciating their
condition. Though lots of arable land were assigned in special
property to individuals, with boundaries both carefully marked
and jealously watched,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162"
class="fnanchor">[162]</a> yet the larger proportion of surface
was devoted to pasture. Cattle formed both the chief item in the
substance of a wealthy man, the chief means of making payments,
and the common ground of quarrels,—bread and meat, in large
quantities, being the constant food of every one.<a id="FNanchor_163"
href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The estates of the
owners were tilled, and their cattle tended, mostly by bought slaves,
but to a certain degree also by poor freemen called Thêtes, working
for hire and for stated periods. The principal slaves, who were
intrusted with the care of large herds of oxen, swine, or goats, were
of necessity men worthy of confidence, their duties placing them away
from their master’s immediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[p.
98]</span> eye.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164"
class="fnanchor">[164]</a> They had other slaves subordinate to
them, and appear to have been well-treated: the deep and unshaken
attachment of Eumæus the swineherd and Philœtius the neatherd to
the family and affairs of the absent Odysseus, is among the most
interesting points in the ancient epic. Slavery was a calamity, which
in that period of insecurity might befall any one: the chief who
conducted a freebooting expedition, if he succeeded, brought back
with him a numerous troop of slaves, as many as he could seize,<a
id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>—if
he failed, became very likely a slave himself: so that the slave was
often by birth of equal dignity with his master: Eumæus was himself
the son of a chief, conveyed away when a child by his nurse, and sold
by Phœnician kidnappers to Laërtês. A slave of this character, if
he conducted himself well, might often expect to be enfranchised by
his master and placed in an independent holding.<a id="FNanchor_166"
href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, the slavery of legendary Greece does not present
itself as existing under a peculiarly harsh form, especially if
we consider that all the classes of society were then very much
upon a level in point of taste, sentiment, and instruction.<a
id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
In the absence of legal security or an effective social sanction,
it is probable that the condition of a slave under an average
master, may have been as good as that of the free Thête. The class
of slaves whose lot appears to have been the most pitiable were
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p. 99]</span> females,—more
numerous than the males, and performing the principal work in
the interior of the house. Not only do they seem to have been
more harshly treated than the males, but they were charged with
the hardest and most exhausting labor which the establishment of
a Greek chief required: they brought in water from the spring,
and turned by hand the house-mills, which ground the large
quantity of flour consumed in his family.<a id="FNanchor_168"
href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> This oppressive
task was performed generally by female slaves, in historical as
well as legendary Greece.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169"
class="fnanchor">[169]</a> Spinning and weaving was the constant
occupation of women, whether free or slave, of every rank and
station: all the garments worn both by men and women were fashioned
at home, and Helen as well as Penelopê is expert and assiduous
at the occupation.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170"
class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The daughters of Keleos at Eleusis
go to the well with their basins for water, and Nausikaa,
daughter of Alkinous,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171"
class="fnanchor">[171]</a> joins her female slaves in the business
of washing her garments in the river. If we are obliged to point
out the fierceness and insecurity of an early society, we may at
the same time note with pleasure its characteristic simplicity
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span> manners:
Rebecca, Rachel, and the daughters of Jethro, in the early
Mosaic narrative, as well as the wife of the native Macedonian
chief (with whom the Temenid Perdiccas, ancestor of Philip and
Alexander, first took service on retiring from Argos), baking her
own cakes on the hearth,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172"
class="fnanchor">[172]</a> exhibit a parallel in this respect to the
Homeric pictures.</p>

<p>We obtain no particulars respecting either the common freemen
generally, or the particular class of them called Thêtes. These
latter, engaged for special jobs, or at the harvest and other
busy seasons of field labor, seem to have given their labor in
exchange for board and clothing: they are mentioned in the same
line with the slaves,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173"
class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and were (as has been just observed)
probably on the whole little better off. The condition of a poor
freeman in those days, without a lot of land of his own, going
about from one temporary job to another, and having no powerful
family and no social authority to look up to for protection,
must have been sufficiently miserable. When Eumæus indulged his
expectation of being manumitted by his masters, he thought at the
same time that they would give him a wife, a house, and a lot of
land near to themselves;<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174"
class="fnanchor">[174]</a> without which collateral advantages,
simple manumission might perhaps have been no improvement in his
condition. To be Thête in the service of a very poor farmer is
selected by Achilles as the maximum of human hardship: such a
person could not give to his Thête the same ample food, and good
shoes and clothing, as the wealthy chief Eurymachus, while he would
exact more severe labor.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175"
class="fnanchor">[175]</a> It was probably among such smaller
occupants, who could not advance the price necessary to purchase
slaves, and were glad to save the cost of keep when they did not
need service, that the Thêtes found employment: though we may
conclude that the brave and strong amongst these poor freemen found
it preferable to accompany some freebooting chief and to live by
the plunder acquired.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176"
class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The exact Hesiod<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span> advises his farmer, whose work is
chiefly performed by slaves, to employ and maintain the Thête during
summer-time, but to dismiss him as soon as the harvest is completely
got in, and then to take into his house for the winter a woman
“without any child;” who would of course be more useful than the
Thête for the indoor occupations of that season.<a id="FNanchor_177"
href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>In a state of society such as that which we have been describing,
Grecian commerce was necessarily trifling and restricted. The
Homeric poems mark either total ignorance or great vagueness of
apprehension respecting all that lies beyond the coasts of Greece
and Asia Minor, and the islands between or adjoining them. Libya
and Egypt are supposed so distant as to be known only by name and
hearsay: indeed, when the city of Kyrene was founded, a century and
a half after the first Olympiad, it was difficult to find anywhere
a Greek navigator who had ever visited the coast of Libya, or
was fit to serve as guide to the colonists.<a id="FNanchor_178"
href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The mention of the
Sikels in the Odyssey,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179"
class="fnanchor">[179]</a> leads us to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_102">[p. 102]</span> conclude that Korkyra, Italy, and
Sicily were not wholly unknown to the poet: among seafaring
Greeks, the knowledge of the latter implied the knowledge of the
two former,—since the habitual track, even of a well-equipped
Athenian trireme during the Peloponnesian war, from Peloponnêsus
to Sicily, was by Korkyra and the Gulf of Tarentum. The Phokæans,
long afterwards, were the first Greeks who explored either the
Adriatic or Tyrrhenian sea.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180"
class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Of the Euxine sea no knowledge is
manifested in Homer, who, as a general rule, presents to us the
names of distant regions only in connection with romantic or
monstrous accompaniments. The Kretans, and still more the Taphians
(who are supposed to have occupied the western islands off the
coast of Acarnania), are mentioned as skilful mariners, and the
Taphian Mentês professes to be conveying iron to Temesa to be there
exchanged for copper;<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181"
class="fnanchor">[181]</a> but both Taphians and Kretans are more
corsairs than traders.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182"
class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The strong sense of the dangers of the
sea, expressed by the poet Hesiod, and the imperfect structure of
the early Grecian ship, attested by Thucydidês (who points out the
more recent date of that improved ship-building which prevailed
in his time), concur to demonstrate the then narrow range of
nautical enterprise.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183"
class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Such was the state of the Greeks, as traders, at a time when
Babylon combined a crowded and industrious population with extensive
commerce, and when the Phœnician merchant-ships visited in one
direction the southern coast of Arabia, perhaps even the island of
Ceylon,—in another direction, the British islands.</p>

<p>The Phœnician, the kinsman of the ancient Jew, exhibits the type
of character belonging to the latter,—with greater enterprise<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span> and ingenuity, and
less of religious exclusiveness, yet still different from, and even
antipathetic to, the character of the Greeks. In the Homeric poems,
he appears somewhat like the Jew of the Middle Ages, a crafty trader,
turning to profit the violence and rapacity of others,—bringing
them ornaments, decorations, the finest and brightest products of
the loom, gold, silver, electrum, ivory, tin, etc., in exchange for
which he received landed produce, skins, wool, and slaves, the only
commodities which even a wealthy Greek chief of those early times
had to offer,—prepared at the same time for dishonest gain, in any
manner which chance might throw in his way.<a id="FNanchor_184"
href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> He is, however,
really a trader, not undertaking expeditions with the deliberate
purpose of surprise and plunder, and standing distinguished in
this respect from the Tyrrhenian, Kretan, or Taphian pirate.
Tin, ivory, and electrum, all of which are acknowledged in the
Homeric poems, were the fruit of Phœnician trade with the West as
well as with the East.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185"
class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span>Thucydidês
tells us that the Phœnicians and Karians, in very early periods,
occupied many of the islands of the Ægean, and we know, from the
striking remnant of their mining works which Herodotus himself saw
in Thasus, off the coast of Thrace, that they had once extracted
gold from the mountains of that island,—at a period indeed very
far back, since their occupation must have been abandoned prior
to the settlement of the poet Archilochus.<a id="FNanchor_186"
href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Yet few of the
islands in the Ægean were rich in such valuable products, nor
was it in the usual course of Phœnician proceeding to occupy
islands, except where there was an adjoining mainland with which
trade could be carried on. The traffic of these active mariners
required no permanent settlement, but as occasional visitors they
were convenient, in enabling a Greek chief to turn his captives
to account,—to get rid of slaves or friendless Thêtes who were
troublesome,—and to supply himself with the metals, precious
as well as useful.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187"
class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The halls of Alki<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span>nous and Menelaus glitter with
gold, copper, and electrum; while large stocks of yet unemployed
metal—gold, copper, and iron—are stored up in the treasure-chamber of
Odysseus and other chiefs.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188"
class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Coined money is unknown to the Homeric
age,—the trade carried on being one of barter. In reference also to
the metals, it deserves to be remarked that the Homeric descriptions
universally suppose copper, and not iron, to be employed for
arms, both offensive and defensive. By what process the copper
was tempered and hardened, so as to serve the purposes of the
warrior, we do not know;<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189"
class="fnanchor">[189]</a> but the use of iron for these objects
belongs to a later age, though the Works and Days of Hesiod suppose
this change to have been already introduced.<a id="FNanchor_190"
href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span>The mode
of fighting among the Homeric heroes is not less different from
the historical times, than the material of which their arms were
composed. The Hoplites, or heavy-armed infantry of historical Greece,
maintained a close order and well-dressed line, charging the enemy
with their spears protended at even distance, and coming thus to
close conflict without breaking their rank: there were special
troops, bowmen, slingers, etc. armed with missiles, but the hoplite
had no weapon to employ in this manner. The heroes of the Iliad and
Odyssey, on the contrary, habitually employ the spear as a missile,
which they launch with tremendous force: each of them is mounted in
his war-chariot, drawn by two horses, and calculated to contain the
warrior and his charioteer; in which latter capacity a friend or
comrade will sometimes consent to serve. Advancing in his chariot at
full speed, in front of his own soldiers, he hurls his spear against
the enemy: sometimes, indeed, he will fight on foot, and hand to
hand, but the chariot is usually near to receive him if he chooses,
or to insure his retreat. The mass of the Greeks and Trojans, coming
forward to the charge, without any regular step or evenly-maintained
line, make their attack in the same way by hurling their spears.
Each chief wears habitually a long sword and a short dagger, besides
his two spears to be launched forward,—the spear being also used, if
occasion serves, as a weapon for thrust. Every man is protected by
shield, helmet, breastplate, and greaves: but the armor of the chiefs
is greatly superior to that of the common men, while they themselves
are both stronger and more expert in the use of their weapons. There
are a few bowmen, as rare exceptions, but the general equipment and
proceeding is as here described.</p>

<p>Such loose array, immortalized as it is in the Iliad, is
familiar to every one; and the contrast which it presents, with
those inflexible ranks, and that irresistible simultaneous charge
which bore down the Persian throng at Platæa and Kunaxa,<a
id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
is such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span> as
to illustrate forcibly the general difference between heroic and
historical Greece. While in the former, a few splendid figures stand
forward, in prominent relief, the remainder being a mere unorganized
and ineffective mass,—in the latter, these units have been combined
into a system, in which every man, officer and soldier, has his
assigned place and duty, and the victory, when gained, is the joint
work of all. Preëminent individual prowess is indeed materially
abridged, if not wholly excluded,—no man can do more than maintain
his station in the line:<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192"
class="fnanchor">[192]</a> but on the other hand, the grand
purposes, aggressive or defensive, for which alone arms are taken
up, become more assured and easy, and long-sighted combinations of
the general are rendered for the first time practicable, when he
has a disciplined body of men to obey him. In tracing the picture
of civil society, we have to remark a similar transition—we pass
from Hêraklês, Thêseus, Jasôn, Achilles, to Solon, Pythagoras, and
Periklês—from “the shepherd of his people,” (to use the phrase
in which Homer depicts the good side of the heroic king,) to the
legislator who introduces, and the statesman who maintains, a
preconcerted system by which willing citizens consent to bind
themselves. If commanding individual talent is not always to be
found, the whole community is so trained as to be able to maintain
its course under inferior leaders; the rights as well as the duties
of each citizen being predetermined in the social order, according to
principles more or less wisely laid down. The contrast is similar,
and the transition equally remarkable, in the civil as in the
military picture. In fact, the military organization of the Grecian
republics is an element of the greatest importance in respect to
the conspicuous part which they have played in human affairs,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p. 108]</span>—their superiority over
other contemporary nations in this respect being hardly less striking
than it is in many others, as we shall have occasion to see in a
subsequent stage of this history.</p>

<p>Even at the most advanced point of their tactics, the Greeks
could effect little against a walled city, whilst the heroic
weapons and array were still less available for such an undertaking
as a siege. Fortifications are a feature of the age deserving
considerable notice. There was a time, we are told, in which the
primitive Greek towns or villages derived a precarious security,
not from their walls, but merely from sites lofty and difficult of
access. They were not built immediately upon the shore, or close
upon any convenient landing-place, but at some distance inland, on
a rock or elevation which could not be approached without notice
or scaled without difficulty. It was thought sufficient at that
time to guard against piratical or marauding surprise: but as the
state of society became assured,—as the chance of sudden assault
comparatively diminished and industry increased,—these uninviting
abodes were exchanged for more convenient sites on the plain or
declivity beneath; or a portion of the latter was inclosed within
larger boundaries and joined on to the original foundation, which
thus became the Acropolis of the new town. Thêbes, Athens, Argos,
etc., belonged to the latter class of cities; but there were in many
parts of Greece deserted sites on hilltops, still retaining, even
in historical times, the traces of former habitation, and some of
them still bearing the name of the old towns. Among the mountainous
parts of Krête, in Ægina and Rhodes, in portions of Mount Ida and
Parnassus, similar remnants might be perceived.<a id="FNanchor_193"
href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span></p> <p>Probably, in
such primitive hill villages, a continuous circle of wall would
hardly be required as an additional means of defence, and would often
be rendered very difficult by the rugged nature of the ground. But
Thucydidês represents the earliest Greeks—those whom he conceives
anterior to the Trojan war—as living thus universally in unfortified
villages, chiefly on account of their poverty, rudeness, and thorough
carelessness for the morrow. Oppressed, and held apart from each
other by perpetual fear, they had not yet contracted the sentiment
of fixed abodes: they were unwilling even to plant fruit-trees
because of the uncertainty of gathering the produce,—and were always
ready to dislodge, because there was nothing to gain by staying,
and a bare subsistence might be had any where. He compares them to
the mountaineers of Ætolia and of the Ozolian Lokris in his own
time, who dwelt in their unfortified hill villages with little or
no intercommunication, always armed and fighting, and subsisting on
the produce of their cattle and their woods,<a id="FNanchor_194"
href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>—clothed in undressed
hides, and eating raw meat.</p>

<p>The picture given by Thucydidês, of these very early and un<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span>recorded times, can only
be taken as conjectural,—the conjectures, indeed, of a statesman and
a philosopher,—generalized too, in part, from the many particular
instances of contention and expulsion of chiefs which he found in
the old legendary poems. The Homeric poems, however, present to us
a different picture. They recognize walled towns, fixed abodes,
strong local attachments, hereditary individual property in land,
vineyards planted and carefully cultivated, established temples of
the gods, and splendid palaces of the chiefs.<a id="FNanchor_195"
href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The description
of Thucydidês belongs to a lower form of society, and bears more
analogy to that which the poet himself conceives as antiquated
and barbarous,—to the savage Cyclopes, who dwell on the tops of
mountains, in hollow caves, without the plough, without vine or
fruit culture, without arts or instruments,—or to the primitive
settlement of Dardanus son of Zeus, on the higher ground of Ida,
while it was reserved for his descendants and successors to found the
holy Ilium on the plain.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196"
class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Ilium or Troy represents the perfection
of Homeric society. It is a consecrated spot, containing temples of
the gods as well as the palace of Priam, and surrounded by walls
which are the fabric of the gods; while the antecedent form of
ruder society, which the poet briefly glances at, is the parallel
of that which the theory of Thucydidês ascribes to his own early
semi-barbarous ancestors.</p>

<p>Walled towns serve thus as one of the evidences, that a large part
of the population of Greece had, even in the Homeric times, reached
a level higher than that of the Ætolians and Lokrians of the days of
Thucydidês. The remains of Mykênæ and Tiryns demonstrate the massy
and Cyclopian style of architecture employed in those early days: but
we may remark that, while modern observers seem inclined to treat the
remains of the former as very imposing, and significant of a great
princely family, Thucydidês, on the contrary, speaks of it as a small
place, and labors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p. 111]</span>
to elude the inference, which might be deduced from its insignificant
size, in disproof of the grandeur of Agamemnôn.<a id="FNanchor_197"
href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Such fortifications
supplied a means of defence incomparably superior to those of
attack. Indeed, even in historical Greece, and after the invention
of battering engines, no city could be taken except by surprise or
blockade, or by ruining the country around, and thus depriving the
inhabitants of their means of subsistence. And in the two great
sieges of the legendary time, Troy and Thêbes, the former is captured
by the stratagem of the wooden horse, while the latter is evacuated
by its citizens, under the warning of the gods, after their defeat in
the field.</p>

<p>This decided superiority of the means of defence over those of
attack, in rude ages, has been one of the grand promotive causes
both of the growth of civic life and of the general march of human
improvement. It has enabled the progressive portions of mankind not
only to maintain their acquisitions against the predatory instincts
of the ruder and poorer, and to surmount the difficulties of
incipient organization,—but ultimately, when their organization has
been matured, both to acquire predominance, and to uphold it until
their own disciplined habits have in part passed to their enemies.
The important truth here stated is illustrated not less by the
history of ancient Greece, than by that of modern Europe during the
Middle Ages. The Homeric chief, combining superior rank with superior
force, and ready to rob at every convenient opportunity, greatly
resembles the feudal baron of the Middle Ages, but circumstances
absorb him more easily into a city life, and convert the
independent potentate into the member of a governing aristocracy.<a
id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>
Traffic by sea continued to be beset with<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span> danger from pirates, long after it
had become tolerably assured by land: the “wet ways” have always
been the last resort of lawlessness and violence, and the Ægean, in
particular, has in all times suffered more than other waters under
this calamity.</p>

<p>Aggressions of the sort here described were of course most
numerous in those earliest times when the Ægean was not yet an
Hellenic sea, and when many of the Cyclades were occupied, not by
Greeks, but by Karians,—perhaps by Phœnicians: the number of Karian
sepulchres discovered in the sacred island of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span> Delus seems to attest such occupation
as an historical fact.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199"
class="fnanchor">[199]</a> According to the legendary account,
espoused both by Herodotus and by Thucydidês, it was the Kretan
Minôs who subdued these islands and established his sons as
rulers in them; either expelling the Karians, or reducing them to
servitude and tribute.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200"
class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Thucydidês presumes that he must of course
have put down piracy, in order to enable his tribute to be remitted
in safety, like the Athenians during the time of their hegemony.<a
id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
Upon the legendary thalassocraty of Minôs, I have already remarked
in another place:<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202"
class="fnanchor">[202]</a> it is sufficient here to repeat, that,
in the Homeric poems (long subsequent to Minôs in the current
chronology), we find piracy both frequent and held in honorable
estimation, as Thucydidês himself emphatically tells us,—remarking,
moreover, that the vessels of those early days were only half-decked,
built and equipped after the piratical fashion,<a id="FNanchor_203"
href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> in a manner upon
which the nautical men of his time looked back with disdain. Improved
and enlarged ship-building, and the trireme, or ship with three banks
of oars, common for warlike purposes during the Persian invasion,
began only with the growing skill, activity, and importance of the
Corinthians, three quarters of a century after the first Olympiad.<a
id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
Corinth, even in the Homeric poems, is distinguished by the epithet
of wealthy, which it acquired principally from its remarkable
situation on the Isthmus, and from its two harbors of Lechæum and
Kenchreæ, the one on the Corinthian, the other on the Sarônic gulf.
It thus supplied a convenient connection between Epirus and Italy on
the one side, and the Ægean sea on the other, without imposing upon
the unskilful and timid navigator of those days the necessity of
circumnavigating Peloponnêsus.</p>

<p>The extension of Grecian traffic and shipping is manifested<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span> by a comparison of
the Homeric with the Hesiodic poems; in respect to knowledge of
places and countries,—the latter being probably referable to dates
between <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 740 and <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 640. In
Homer, acquaintance is shown (the accuracy of such acquaintance,
however, being exaggerated by Strabo and other friendly critics)
with continental Greece and its neighboring islands, with Krête and
the principal islands of the Ægean, and with Thrace, the Troad, the
Hellespont, and Asia Minor between Paphlagonia northward and Lykia
southward. The Sikels are mentioned in the Odyssey, and Sikania
in the last book of that poem, but nothing is said to evince a
knowledge of Italy or the realities of the western world. Libya,
Egypt, and Phœnike, are known by name and by vague hearsay, but the
Nile is only mentioned as “the river Egypt:” while the Euxine sea
is not mentioned at all.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205"
class="fnanchor">[205]</a> In the Hesiodic poems, on the other
hand, the Nile, the Ister, the Phasis, and the Eridanus, are
all specified by name;<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206"
class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Mount Ætna, and the island of Ortygia
near to Syracuse, the Tyrrhenians and Ligurians in the west, and
the Scythians in the north, were also noticed.<a id="FNanchor_207"
href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Indeed, within forty
years after the first Olympiad, the cities of Korkyra and Syracuse
were founded from Corinth,—the first of a numerous and powerful
series of colonies, destined to impart a new character both to the
south of Italy and to Sicily.</p>

<p>In reference to the astronomy and physics of the Homeric Greek,
it has already been remarked that he connected together the sensible
phenomena which form the subject matter of these sciences by threads
of religious and personifying fancy, to which the real analogies
among them were made subordinate; and that these analogies did not
begin to be studied by themselves, apart<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span> from the religious element by which
they had been at first overlaid, until the age of Thales,—coinciding
as that period did with the increased opportunities for visiting
Egypt and the interior of Asia. The Greeks obtained access in both of
these countries to an enlarged stock of astronomical observations,
to the use of the gnomon, or sundial,<a id="FNanchor_208"
href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> and to a more exact
determination of the length of the solar year,<a id="FNanchor_209"
href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> than that which
served as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p. 116]</span>
basis of their various lunar periods. It is pretended that Thales
was the first who predicted an eclipse of the sun,—not, indeed,
accurately, but with large limits of error as to the time of its
occurrence,—and that he also possessed so profound an acquaintance
with meteorological phenomena and probabilities, as to be able
to foretell an abundant crop of olives for the coming year,
and to realize a large sum of money by an olive speculation.<a
id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>From Thales downward we trace a succession of astronomical and
physical theories, more or less successful, into which I do not
intend here to enter: it is sufficient at present to contrast the
father of the Ionic philosophy with the times preceding him, and
to mark the first commencement of scientific prediction among the
Greeks, however imperfect at the outset, as distinguished from the
inspired dicta of prophets or oracles, and from those special signs
of the purposes of the gods, which formed the habitual reliance
of the Homeric man.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211"
class="fnanchor">[211]</a> We shall see these two modes of
anticipating the future,—one based upon the philosophical, the other
upon the religious appreciation of nature,—running simultaneously
on throughout Grecian history, and sharing between them in unequal
portions the empire of the Greek mind; the former acquiring both
greater predominance and wider application among the intellectual
men, and partially restricting, but never abolishing, the spontaneous
employment of the latter among the vulgar.</p>

<p>Neither coined money, nor the art of writing,<a id="FNanchor_212"
href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> nor painting, nor
sculpture, nor imaginative architecture, belong to the Homeric and
Hesiodic times. Such rudiments of arts, destined ultimately to
acquire so great a development in Greece, as may have existed in
these early days, served only as a sort of nucleus to the fancy of
the poet, to shape out for himself the fabulous<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span> creations ascribed to Hephæstus or
Dædalus. No statues of the gods, not even of wood, are mentioned in
the Homeric poems. All the many varieties, in Grecian music, poetry,
and dancing,—the former chiefly borrowed from Lydia and Phrygia,—date
from a period considerably later than the first Olympiad: Terpander,
the earliest musician whose date is assigned, and the inventor of
the harp with seven strings instead of that with four strings, does
not come until the 26th Olympiad, or 676 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>: the
poet Archilochus is nearly of the same date. The iambic and elegiac
metres—the first deviations from the primitive epic strain and
subject—do not reach up to the year 700 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

<p>It is this epic poetry which forms at once both the undoubted
prerogative and the solitary jewel of the earliest era of Greece. Of
the many epic poems which existed in Greece during the eight century
before the Christian era, none have been preserved except the Iliad
and Odyssey: the Æthiopis of Arktinus, the Ilias Minor of Lesches,
the Cyprian Verses, the Capture of Œchalia, the Returns of the Heroes
from Troy, the Thêbaïs and the Epigoni,—several of them passing in
antiquity under the name of Homer,—have all been lost. But the two
which remain are quite sufficient to demonstrate in the primitive
Greeks, a mental organization unparalleled in any other people,
and powers of invention and expression which prepared, as well as
foreboded, the future eminence of the nation in all the various
departments to which thought and language can be applied. Great as
the power of thought afterwards became among the Greeks, their power
of expression was still greater: in the former, other nations have
built upon their foundations and surpassed them,—in the latter,
they still remained unrivalled. It is not too much to say that this
flexible, emphatic, and transparent character of the language as an
instrument of communication,—its perfect aptitude for narrative and
discussion, as well as for stirring all the veins of human emotion
without ever forfeiting that character of simplicity which adapts
it to all men and all times,—may be traced mainly to the existence
and the wide-spread influence of the Iliad and Odyssey. To us, these
compositions are interesting as beautiful poems, depicting life and
manners, and unfolding certain types of character with the utmost
vivacity and artlessness: to their original hearer, they possessed
all these sources of attrac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p.
118]</span>tion, together with others more powerful still, to which
we are now strangers. Upon him, they bore with the full weight and
solemnity of history and religion combined, while the charm of the
poetry was only secondary and instrumental. The poet was then the
teacher and preacher of the community, not simply the amuser of their
leisure hours: they looked to him for revelations of the unknown
past and for expositions of the attributes and dispensations of the
gods, just as they consulted the prophet for his privileged insight
into the future. The ancient epic comprised many different poets and
poetical compositions, which fulfilled this purpose with more or
less completeness: but it is the exclusive prerogative of the Iliad
and Odyssey, that, after the minds of men had ceased to be in full
harmony with their original design, they yet retained their empire
by the mere force of secondary excellences: while the remaining
epics—though serving as food for the curious, and as storehouses for
logographers, tragedians, and artists—never seem to have acquired
very wide popularity even among intellectual Greeks.</p>

<p>I shall, in the succeeding chapter, give some account of the
epic cycle, of its relation to the Homeric poems, and of the
general evidences respecting the latter, both as to antiquity and
authorship.</p>

    GRECIAN EPIC.—HOMERIC POEMS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">At the</span> head of the once
abundant epical compositions of Greece, most of them unfortunately
lost, stand the Iliad and Odyssey, with the immortal name of
Homer attached to each of them, embracing separate portions of
the comprehensive legend of Troy. They form the type of what may
be called the heroic epic of the Greeks, as distinguished from
the genealogical, in which latter species some of the Hesiodic
poems—the Catalogue of Women, the Eoiai, and the Naupaktia<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span>—stood conspicuous.
Poems of the Homeric character (if so it may be called, though the
expression is very indefinite,)—being confined to one of the great
events, or great personages of Grecian legendary antiquity, and
comprising a limited number of characters, all contemporaneous, made
some approach, more or less successful, to a certain poetical unity;
while the Hesiodic poems, tamer in their spirit, and unconfined
both as to time and as to persons, strung together distinct events
without any obvious view to concentration of interest,—without
legitimate beginning or end.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213"
class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Between these two extremes there were many
gradations: biographical poems, such as the Herakleia, or Theseïs,
recounting all the principal exploits performed by one single hero,
present a character intermediate between the two, but bordering more
closely on the Hesiodic. Even the hymns to the gods, which pass
under the name of Homer, are epical fragments, narrating particular
exploits or adventures of the god commemorated.</p>

<p>Both the didactic and the mystico-religious poetry of Greece
began in Hexameter verse,—the characteristic and consecrated
measure of the epic:<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214"
class="fnanchor">[214]</a> but they belong to a different species,
and burst out from a different vein in the Grecian mind. It seems to
have been the more common belief among the historical Greeks, that
such mystic effusions were more ancient than their narrative poems,
and that Orpheus, Musæus, Linus, Olên, Pamphus, and even Hesiod,
etc., etc., the reputed composers of the former, were of earlier date
than Homer. But there is no evidence to sustain this opinion, and
the presumptions are all against it. Those compositions, which in
the sixth century before the Christian era passed under the name of
Orpheus and Musæus, seem to have been unquestionably post-Homeric,
nor can we even admit the modified conclusion of Hermann, Ulrici,
and others, that the mystic poetry as a genus (putting aside the
particular compositions falsely ascribed to Orpheus and others)
preceded in order of time the narrative.<a id="FNanchor_215"
href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span>Besides the
Iliad and Odyssey, we make out the titles of about thirty lost epic
poems, sometimes with a brief hint of their contents.</p>

<p>Concerning the legend of Troy there were five: the Cyprian Verses,
the Æthiopis, and the Capture of Troy, both ascribed to Arktinus; the
lesser Iliad, ascribed to Leschês; the Returns (of the Heroes from
Troy), to which the name of Hagias of Trœzên is attached; and the
Telegonia, by Eugammôn, a continuation of the Odyssey. Two poems,—the
Thebaïs and the Epigoni (perhaps two parts of one and the same poem)
were devoted to the legend of Thebês,—the two sieges of that city by
the Argeians. Another poem, called Œdipodia, had for its subject the
tragical destiny of Œdipus and his family; and perhaps that which
is cited as Eurôpia, or verses on Eurôpa, may have comprehended
the tale of her brother Kadmus, the mythical founder of Thebês.<a
id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The exploits of Hêraklês were celebrated in two compositions,
each called Hêrakleia, by Kinæthôn and Pisander,—probably also
in many others, of which the memory has not been preserved. The
capture of Œchalia, by Hêraklês, formed the subject of a separate
epic. Two other poems, the Ægimius and the Minyas, are supposed to
have been founded on other achievements of this hero,—the effective
aid which he lent to the Dorian king Ægimius against the Lapithæ,
his descent to the under-world for the purpose of rescuing the
imprisoned Thêseus, and his conquest of the city of the Minyæ,
the powerful Orchomenus.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217"
class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>Other epic poems—the Phorônis, the Danaïs, the Alkmæônis,
the Atthis, the Amazonia—we know only by name, and can
just guess obscurely at their contents so far as the
name indicates.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218"
class="fnanchor">[218]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p.
121]</span> The Titanomachia, the Gigantomachia, and the Corinthiaca,
three compositions all ascribed to Eumêlus, afford by means of their
titles an idea somewhat clearer of the matter which they comprised.
The Theogony ascribed to Hesiod still exists, though partially
corrupt and mutilated: but there seem to have been other poems, now
lost, of the like import and title.</p>

<p>Of the poems composed in the Hesiodic style, diffusive and full of
genealogical detail, the principal were, the Catalogue of Women and
the Great Eoiai; the latter of which, indeed, seems to have been a
continuation of the former. A large number of the celebrated women of
heroic Greece were commemorated in these poems, one after the other,
without any other than an arbitrary bond of connection. The Marriage
of Kêyx,—the Melampodia,—and a string of fables called Astronomia,
are farther ascribed to Hesiod: and the poem above mentioned, called
Ægimius, is also sometimes connected with his name, sometimes with
that of Kerkops. The Naupaktian Verses (so called, probably, from
the birthplace of their author), and the genealogies of Kinæthôn and
Asius, were compositions of the same rambling character, as far as we
can judge from the scanty fragments remaining.<a id="FNanchor_219"
href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> The Orchomenian
epic poet Chersias, of whom two lines only are preserved to us
by Pausanias, may reasonably be referred to the same category.<a
id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The oldest of the epic poets, to whom any date, carrying with it
the semblance of authority, is assigned, is Arktinus of Milêtus,
who is placed by Eusebius in the first Olympiad, and by Suidas
in the ninth. Eugammôn, the author of the Telegonia, and the
latest of the catalogue, is placed in the fifty-third Olympiad,
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 566. Between these two we find Asius and
Leschês, about the thirtieth Olympiad,—a time when the vein of the
ancient epic was drying up, and when other forms of poetry—elegiac,
iambic, lyric, and choric—had either already arisen, or were on
the point of arising, to compete with it.<a id="FNanchor_221"
href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span></p> <p>It has already
been stated in a former chapter, that in the early commencements of
prose-writing, Hekatæus, Pherekydês, and other logographers, made
it their business to extract from the ancient fables something like
a continuous narrative, chronologically arranged. It was upon a
principle somewhat analogous that the Alexandrine literati, about
the second century before the Christian era,<a id="FNanchor_222"
href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> arranged the multitude
of old epic poets into a series founded on the supposed order of time
in the events narrated,—beginning with the intermarriage of Uranus and
Gæa, and the Theogony,—and concluding with the death of Odysseus by the
hands of his son Telegonus. This collection passed by the name of the
Epic Cycle, and the poets, whose compositions were embodied in it, were
termed Cyclic poets. Doubtless, the epical treasures of the Alexandrine
library were larger than had ever before been brought together and
submitted to men both of learning and leisure: so that multiplication
of such compositions in the same museum rendered it advisable to
establish some fixed order of perusal, and to copy them in one
corrected and uniform edition.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223"
class="fnanchor">[223]</a> It pleased the critics to determine
precedence, neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p. 123]</span>
by antiquity nor by excellence of the compositions themselves, but by
the supposed sequence of narrative, so that the whole taken together
constituted a readable aggregate of epical antiquity.</p>

<p>Much obscurity<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224"
class="fnanchor">[224]</a> exists, and many different opinions have
been expressed, respecting this Epic Cycle: I view it, not as an
exclusive canon, but simply as an all-comprehensive classification,
with a new edition founded thereupon. It would include all the epic
poems in the library older than the Telegonia, and apt for continuous
narrative; it would exclude only two classes,—first, the recent
epic poets, such as Panyasis and Antimachus; next, the genealogical
and desultory poems, such as the Catalogue of Women, the Eoiai,
and others, which could not be made to fit in to any chronological
sequence of events.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225"
class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Both the Iliad and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_124">[p. 124]</span> the Odyssey were comprised in the
Cycle, so that the denomination of cyclic poet did not originally
or designedly carry with it any association of contempt. But as the
great and capital poems were chiefly spoken of by themselves, or
by the title of their own separate authors, so the general name of
<i>poets of the Cycle</i> came gradually to be applied only to the worst,
and thus to imply vulgarity or common-place; the more so, as many of
the inferior compositions included in the collection seem to have
been anonymous, and their authors in consequence describable only
under some such common designation as that of the cyclic poets. It
is in this manner that we are to explain the disparaging sentiment
connected by Horace and others with the idea of a cyclic writer,
though no such sentiment was implied in the original meaning of the
Epic Cycle.</p>

<p>The poems of the Cycle were thus mentioned in contrast and
antithesis with Homer,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226"
class="fnanchor">[226]</a> though originally the Iliad and
Odyssey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[p. 125]</span> had both
been included among them: and this alteration of the meaning of the
word has given birth to a mistake as to the primary purpose of the
classification, as if it had been designed especially to part off
the inferior epic productions from Homer. But while some critics
are disposed to distinguish the cyclic poets too pointedly from
Homer, I conceive that Welcker goes too much into the other extreme,
and identifies the Cycle too closely with that poet. He construes
it as a classification deliberately framed to comprise all the
various productions of the Homeric epic, with its unity of action
and comparative paucity, both of persons and adventures,—as opposed
to the Hesiodic epic, crowded with separate persons and pedigrees,
and destitute of central action as well as of closing catastrophe.
This opinion does, indeed, coincide to a great degree with the fact,
inasmuch as few of the Hesiodic epics appear to have been included in
the Cycle: to say that <i>none</i> were included, would be too much, for
we cannot venture to set aside either the Theogony or the Ægimius;
but we may account for their absence perfectly well without supposing
any design to exclude them, for it is obvious that their rambling
character (like that of the Metamorphoses of Ovid) forbade the
possibility of interweaving them in any continuous series. Continuity
in the series of narrated events, coupled with a certain degree of
antiquity in the poems, being the principle on which the arrangement
called the Epic Cycle was based, the Hesiodic poems generally were
excluded, not from any preconceived intention, but because they could
not be brought into harmony with such orderly reading.</p>

<p>What were the particular poems which it comprised, we cannot
now determine with exactness. Welcker arranges them as<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[p. 126]</span> follows: Titanomachia,
Danaïs, Amazonia (or Atthis), Œdipodia, Thebaïs (or Expedition of
Amphiaräus), Epigoni (or Alkmæônis), Minyas (or Phokaïs), Capture of
Œchalia, Cyprian Verses, Iliad, Æthiopis, Lesser Iliad, Iliupersis or
the Taking of Troy, Returns of the Heroes, Odyssey, and Telegonia.
Wuellner, Lange, and Mr. Fynes Clinton enlarge the list of cyclic
poems still farther.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227"
class="fnanchor">[227]</a> But all such reconstructions of the Cycle
are conjectural and destitute of authority: the only poems which we
can affirm on positive grounds to have been comprehended in it, are,
first, the series respecting the heroes of Troy, from the Cypria to
the Telegonia, of which Proclus has preserved the arguments, and
which includes the Iliad and Odyssey,—next, the old Thebaïs, which
is expressly termed cyclic,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228"
class="fnanchor">[228]</a> in order to distinguish it from the
poem of the same name composed by Antimachus. In regard to other
particular compositions, we have no evidence to guide us, either
for admission or exclusion, except our general views as to the
scheme upon which the Cycle was framed. If my idea of that scheme be
correct, the Alexandrine critics arranged therein <i>all</i> their old
epical treasures, down to the Telegonia,—the good as well as the
bad; gold, silver, and iron,—provided only they could be pieced in
with the narrative series. But I cannot venture to include, as Mr.
Clinton does, the Eurôpia, the Phorônis, and other poems of which we
know only the names, because it is uncertain whether their contents
were such as to fulfil their primary condition: nor can I concur with
him in thinking that, where there were two or more poems of the same
title and subject, one of them must necessarily have been adopted
into the Cycle to the exclusion of the others. There may have been
two Theogonies, or two Herakleias, both comprehended in the Cycle;
the purpose being (as I before remarked), not to sift the better from
the worse, but to determine some fixed order, convenient for reading
and reference, amidst a multiplicity of scattered compositions, as
the basis of a new, entire, and corrected edition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span>Whatever may
have been the principle on which the cyclic poems were originally
strung together, they are all now lost, except those two unrivalled
diamonds, whose brightness, dimming all the rest, has alone sufficed
to confer imperishable glory even upon the earliest phase of Grecian
life. It has been the natural privilege of the Iliad and Odyssey,
from the rise of Grecian philology down to the present day, to
provoke an intense curiosity, which, even in the historical and
literary days of Greece, there were no assured facts to satisfy.
These compositions are the monuments of an age essentially religious
and poetical, but essentially also unphilosophical, unreflecting, and
unrecording: the nature of the case forbids our having any authentic
transmitted knowledge respecting such a period; and the lesson must
be learned, hard and painful though it be, that no imaginable reach
of critical acumen will of itself enable us to discriminate fancy
from reality, in the absence of a tolerable stock of evidence.
After the numberless comments and acrimonious controversies<a
id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
to which the Homeric poems have given rise, it can hardly be said
that any of the points originally doubtful have obtained a solution
such as to command universal acquiescence. To glance at all these
controversies, however briefly, would far transcend the limits of
the present work; but the most abridged Grecian history would be
incomplete without some inquiry respecting <i>the Poet</i> (so the Greek
critics in their veneration denominated Homer), and the productions
which pass now, or have heretofore passed, under his name.</p>

<p>Who or what was Homer? What date is to be assigned to him? What
were his compositions?</p>

<p>A person, putting these questions to Greeks of different towns
and ages, would have obtained answers widely discrepant and
contradictory. Since the invaluable labors of Aristarchus and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span> the other Alexandrine
critics on the text of the Iliad and Odyssey, it has, indeed, been
customary to regard those two (putting aside the Hymns, and a few
other minor poems) as being the only genuine Homeric compositions:
and the literary men called Chorizontes, or the Separators, at the
head of whom were Xenôn and Hellanikus, endeavored still farther
to reduce the number by disconnecting the Iliad and Odyssey, and
pointing out that both could not be the work of the same author.
Throughout the whole course of Grecian antiquity, the Iliad and
the Odyssey, and the Hymns, have been received as Homeric: but
if we go back to the time of Herodotus, or still earlier, we
find that several other epics also were ascribed to Homer,—and
there were not wanting<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230"
class="fnanchor">[230]</a> critics, earlier than the Alexandrine
age, who regarded the whole Epic Cycle, together with the satirical
poem called Margitês, the Batrachomyomachia, and other smaller
pieces, as Homeric works. The cyclic Thebaïs and the Epigoni
(whether they be two separate poems, or the latter a second part
of the former) were in early days currently ascribed to Homer: the
same was the case with the Cyprian Verses: some even attributed to
him several other poems,<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231"
class="fnanchor">[231]</a> the Capture of Œchalia, the Lesser Iliad,
the Phokaïs, and the Amazonia. The title of the poem called Thebaïs
to be styled Homeric, depends upon evidence more ancient than any
which can be produced to authenticate the Iliad and Odyssey: for
Kallinus, the ancient elegiac poet (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 640),
mentioned Homer as the author of it,—and his opinion was shared by
many other competent judges.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232"
class="fnanchor">[232]</a> From the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_129">[p. 129]</span> remarkable description given by
Herodotus, of the expulsion of the rhapsodes from Sikyôn, by the
despot Kleisthenês, in the time of Solôn (about <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
580), we may form a probable judgment that the Thebaïs and the
Epigoni were then rhapsodized at Sikyôn as Homeric productions.<a
id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> And
it is clear from the language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p.
130]</span> of Herodotus, that in his time the general opinion
ascribed to Homer both the Cyprian Verses and the Epigoni, though
he himself dissents.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234"
class="fnanchor">[234]</a> In spite of such dissent, however, that
historian must have conceived the names of Homer and Hesiod to be
nearly coextensive with the whole of the ancient epic; otherwise, he
would hardly have delivered his memorable judgment, that they two
were the framers of Grecian theogony.</p>

<p>The many different cities which laid claim to the birth of Homer
(seven is rather below the truth, and Smyrna and Chios are the most
prominent among them,) is well known, and most of them had legends to
tell respecting his romantic parentage, his alleged blindness, and
his life of an itinerant bard, acquainted with poverty and sorrow.<a
id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> The
discrepancies of statement re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p.
131]</span>specting the date of his reputed existence are no less
worthy of remark; for out of the eight different epochs assigned to
him, the oldest differs from the most recent by a period of four
hundred and sixty years.</p>

<p>Thus conflicting would have been the answers returned in different
portions of the Grecian world to any questions respecting the person
of Homer. But there were a poetical gens (fraternity or guild) in
the Ionic island of Chios, who, if the question had been put to
them, would have answered in another manner. To them, Homer was not
a mere antecedent man, of kindred nature with themselves, but a
divine or semi-divine eponymus and progenitor, whom they worshipped
in their gentile sacrifices, and in whose ascendent name and glory
the individuality of every member of the gens was merged. The
compositions of each separate Homêrid, or the combined efforts of
many of them in conjunction, were the works of Homer: the name of the
individual bard perishes and his authorship is forgotten, but the
common gentile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span>
father lives and grows in renown, from generation to generation, by
the genius of his self-renewing sons.</p>

<p>Such was the conception entertained of Homer by the poetical
gens called Homêridæ, or Homêrids; and in the general obscurity of
the whole case, I lean towards it as the most plausible conception.
Homer is not only the reputed author of the various compositions
emanating from the gentile members, but also the recipient of the
many different legends and of the divine genealogy, which it pleases
their imagination to confer upon him. Such manufacture of fictitious
personality, and such perfect incorporation of the entities of
religion and fancy with the real world, is a process familiar,
and even habitual, in the retrospective vision of the Greeks.<a
id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>It is to be remarked, that the poetical gens here brought to view,
the Homêrids, are of indisputable authenticity. Their existence and
their considerations were maintained down to the historical times
in the island of Chios.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237"
class="fnanchor">[237]</a> If the Homêrids were still conspicuous,
even in the days of Akusilaus, Pindar, Hellanikus, and Plato, when
their productive invention had ceased, and when they had become only
guardians and distributors, in common with others, of the treasures
bequeathed by their predecessors,—far more exalted must their
position have been three centuries before, while they were still the
inspired creators of epic novelty, and when the absence of writing
assured to them the undisputed monopoly of their own compositions.<a
id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span>Homer, then,
is no individual man, but the divine or heroic father (the ideas
of worship and ancestry coalescing, as they constantly did in the
Grecian mind) of the gentile Homêrids, and he is the author of the
Thebaïs, the Epigoni, the Cyprian Verses, the Proœms, or Hymns, and
other poems, in the same sense in which he is the author of the
Iliad and Odyssey,—assuming that these various compositions emanate,
as perhaps they may, from different individuals numbered among the
Homêrids. But this disallowance of the historical personality of
Homer is quite distinct from the question, with which it has been
often confounded, whether the Iliad and Odyssey are originally
entire poems, and whether by one author or otherwise. To us, the
name of Homer means these two poems, and little else: we desire to
know as much as can be learned respecting their date, their original
composition, their preservation, and their mode of communication to
the public. All these questions are more or less complicated one with
the other.</p>

<p>Concerning the date of the poems, we have no other information
except the various affirmations respecting the age of Homer,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p. 134]</span> which differ among
themselves (as I have before observed) by an interval of four
hundred and sixty years, and which for the most part determine the
date of Homer by reference to some other event, itself fabulous
and unauthenticated,—such as the Trojan war, the Return of the
Hêrakleids, or the Ionic migration. Kratês placed Homer earlier than
the Return of the Hêrakleids, and less than eighty years after the
Trojan war: Eratosthenês put him one hundred years after the Trojan
war: Aristotle, Aristarchus, and Castor made his birth contemporary
with the Ionic migration, while Apollodôrus brings him down to one
hundred years after that event, or two hundred and forty years after
the taking of Troy. Thucydidês assigns to him a date much subsequent
to the Trojan war.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239"
class="fnanchor">[239]</a> On the other hand, Theopompus and
Euphoriôn refer his age to the far more recent period of the Lydian
king, Gyges, (Ol. 18-23, <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 708-688,) and put
him five hundred years after the Trojan epoch.<a id="FNanchor_240"
href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> What were the
grounds of these various conjectures, we do not know; though in the
statements of Kratês and Eratosthenês, we may pretty well divine.
But the oldest dictum preserved to us respecting the date of
Homer,—meaning thereby the date of the Iliad and Odyssey,—appears
to me at the same time the most credible, and the most consistent
with the general history of the ancient epic. Herodotus places Homer
four hundred years before himself; taking his departure, not from
any fabulous event, but from a point of real and authentic time.<a
id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
Four centuries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span>
anterior to Herodotus would be a period commencing with 880
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> so that the composition of the Homeric
poems would thus fall in a space between 850 and 800 <small>B.
C.</small> We may gather from the language of Herodotus that this was
his own judgment, opposed to a current opinion, which assigned the
poet to an earlier epoch.</p>

<p>To place the Iliad and Odyssey at some periods between 850
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> and 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, appears to me more
probable than any other date, anterior or posterior,—more probable
than the latter, because we are justified in believing these two
poems to be older than Arktinus, who comes shortly after the first
Olympiad;—more probable than the former, because, the farther we
push the poems back, the more do we enhance the wonder of their
preservation, already sufficiently great, down from such an age and
society to the historical times.</p>

<p>The mode in which these poems, and indeed all poems, epic as well
as lyric, down to the age (probably) of Peisistratus, were circulated
and brought to bear upon the public, deserves particular attention.
They were not read by individuals alone and apart, but sung or
recited at festivals or to assembled companies. This seems to be one
of the few undisputed facts with regard to the great poet: for even
those who maintain that the Iliad and Odyssey were preserved by means
of writing, seldom contend that they were read.</p>

<p>In appreciating the effect of the poems, we must always take
account of this great difference between early Greece and our own
times,—between the congregation mustered at a solemn festival,
stimulated by community of sympathy, listening to a measured and
musical recital from the lips of trained bards or rhapsodes, whose
matter was supposed to have been inspired by the Muse,—and the
solitary reader, with a manuscript before him; such manuscript
being, down to a very late period in Greek literature, indifferently
written, without division into parts, and without marks of
punctuation. As in the case of dramatic per<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span>formances, in all ages, so in that of
the early Grecian epic,—a very large proportion of its impressive
effect was derived from the talent of the reciter and the force of
the general accompaniments, and would have disappeared altogether
in solitary reading. Originally, the bard sung his own epical
narrative, commencing with a proœmium or hymn to one of the gods:<a
id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
his profession was separate and special, like that of the carpenter,
the leech, or the prophet: his manner and enunciation must have
required particular training no less than his imaginative faculty.
His character presents itself in the Odyssey as one highly esteemed;
and in the Iliad, even Achilles does not disdain to touch the lyre
with his own hands, and to sing heroic deeds.<a id="FNanchor_243"
href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Not only did the
Iliad and Odyssey, and the poems embodied in the Epic Cycle, produce
all their impression and gain all their renown by this process of
oral delivery, but even the lyric and choric poets who succeeded
them were known and felt in the same way by the general public, even
after the full establishment of habits of reading among lettered men.
While in the case of the epic, the recitation or singing had been
extremely simple, and the measure comparatively little diversified,
with no other accompaniment than that of the four-stringed harp,—all
the variations superinduced upon the original hexameter, beginning
with the pentameter and iambus, and proceeding step by step to the
com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span>plicated
strophês of Pindar and the tragic writers, still left the general
effect of the poetry greatly dependent upon voice and accompaniments,
and pointedly distinguished from mere solitary reading of the
words. And in the dramatic poetry, the last in order of time, the
declamation and gesture of the speaking actor alternated with the
song and dance of the chorus, and with the instruments of musicians,
the whole being set off by imposing visible decorations. Now both
dramatic effect and song are familiar in modern times, so that every
man knows the difference between reading the words and hearing
them under the appropriate circumstances: but poetry, as such, is,
and has now long been, so exclusively enjoyed by reading, that it
requires an especial memento to bring us back to the time when the
Iliad and Odyssey were addressed only to the ear and feelings of a
promiscuous and sympathizing multitude. Readers there were none, at
least until the century preceding Solôn and Peisistratus: from that
time forward, they gradually increased both in number and influence;
though doubtless small, even in the most literary period of Greece,
as compared with modern European society. So far as the production
of beautiful epic poetry was concerned, however, the select body
of instructed readers, furnished a less potent stimulus than the
unlettered and listening crowd of the earlier periods. The poems
of Chœrilus and Antimachus, towards the close of the Peloponnesian
war, though admired by erudite men, never acquired popularity;
and the emperor Hadrian failed in his attempt to bring the latter
poet into fashion at the expense of Homer.<a id="FNanchor_244"
href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span>It will be
seen by what has been here stated, that that class of men, who
formed the medium of communication between the verse and the ear,
were of the highest importance in the ancient world, and especially
in the earlier periods of its career,—the bards and rhapsodes for
the epic, the singers for the lyric, the actors and singers jointly
with the dancers for the chorus and drama. The lyric and dramatic
poets taught with their own lips the delivery of their compositions,
and so prominently did this business of teaching present itself
to the view of the public, that the name Didaskalia, by which the
dramatic exhibition was commonly designated, derived from thence its
origin.</p>

<p>Among the number of rhapsodes who frequented the festivals at a
time when Grecian cities were multiplied and easy of access, for
the recitation of the ancient epic, there must have been of course
great differences of excellence; but that the more considerable
individuals of the class were elaborately trained and highly
accomplished in the exercise of their profession, we may assume
as certain. But it happens that Socrates, with his two pupils
Plato and Xenophon, speak contemptuously of their merits; and many
persons have been disposed, somewhat too readily, to admit this
sentence of condemnation as conclusive, without taking account of
the point of view from which it was delivered.<a id="FNanchor_245"
href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> These<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span> philosophers considered
Homer and other poets with a view to instruction, ethical doctrine,
and virtuous practice: they analyzed the characters whom the poet
described, sifted the value of the lessons conveyed, and often
struggled to discover a hidden meaning, where they disapproved
that which was apparent. When they found a man like the rhapsode,
who professed to impress the Homeric narrative upon an audience,
and yet either never meddled at all, or meddled unsuccessfully,
with the business of exposition, they treated him with contempt;
indeed, Socrates depreciates the poets themselves, much upon the
same principle, as dealing with matters of which they could render
no rational account.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246"
class="fnanchor">[246]</a> It was also the habit of Plato and
Xenophôn to disparage generally professional exertion of talent
for the purpose of gaining a livelihood, contrasting it often in
an indelicate manner with the gratuitous teaching and ostentatious
poverty of their master. But we are not warranted in judging the
rhapsodes by such a standard. Though they were not philosophers or
moralists, it was their province—and it had been so, long before
the philosophical point of view was opened—to bring their poet home
to the bosoms and emotions of an assembled crowd, and to penetrate
themselves with his meaning so far as was suitable for that purpose,
adapting to it the appropriate graces of action and intonation. In
this their genuine task they were valuable members of the Grecian
community, and seem to have possessed all the qualities necessary for
success.</p>

<p>These rhapsodes, the successors of the primitive aœdi, or bards,
seem to have been distinguished from them by the discontinuance of
all musical accompaniment. Originally, the bard sung, enlivening
the song with occasional touches of the simple four-stringed harp:
his successor, the rhapsode, recited, holding<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span> in his hand nothing but a branch
of laurel and depending for effect upon voice and manner,—a
species of musical and rhythmical declamation,<a id="FNanchor_247"
href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> which gradually
increased in vehement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[p.
141]</span> emphasis and gesticulation until it approached to that of
the dramatic actor. At what time this change took place, or whether
the two different modes of enunciating the ancient epic may for a
certain period have gone on simultaneously, we have no means of
determining. Hesiod receives from the Muse a branch of laurel, as a
token of his ordination into their service, which marks him for a
rhapsode; while the ancient bard with his harp is still recognized in
the Homeric Hymn to the Delian Apollo, as efficient and popular at
the Panionic festivals in the island of Delos.<a id="FNanchor_248"
href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Perhaps the
improvements made in the harp, to which three strings, in addition to
the original four, were attached by Terpander (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
660), and the growing complication of instrumental music generally,
may have contributed to discredit the primitive accompaniment, and
thus to promote the practice of recital: the story, that Terpander
himself composed music, not only for hexameter poems of his own,
but also for those of Homer, seems to indicate that the music
which preceded him was ceasing to find favor.<a id="FNanchor_249"
href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> By whatever steps the
change from the bard to the rhapsode took place, certain it is that
before the time of Solôn, the latter was the recognized and exclusive
organ of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span> the
old Epic; sometimes in short fragments before private companies,
by single rhapsodes,—sometimes several rhapsodes in continuous
succession at a public festival.</p>

<p>Respecting the mode in which the Homeric poems were preserved,
during the two centuries (or as some think, longer interval)
between their original composition and the period shortly preceding
Solôn,—and respecting their original composition and subsequent
changes,—there are wide differences of opinion among able critics.
Were they preserved with or without being written? Was the Iliad
originally composed as one poem, and the Odyssey in like manner, or
is each of them an aggregation of parts originally self-existent
and unconnected? Was the authorship of each poem single-headed or
many-headed?</p>

<p>Either tacitly or explicitly, these questions have been generally
coupled together and discussed with reference to each other,
by inquiries into the Homeric poems; though Mr. Payne Knight’s
Prolegomena have the merit of keeping them distinct. Half a century
ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf, turning to
account the Venetian Scholia which had then been recently published,
first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the
Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by no
means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously
announced by Bentley, among others, that the separate constituent
portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together
into any compact body and unchangeable order until the days of
Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards
that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either
poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times to which
their composition is referred,—and that without writing, neither the
perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally
conceived by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with
assurance to posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing,
such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among
the early Greeks, was thus one of the points in Wolf’s case against
the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch and
other leading opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the
other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has
been considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span>
incumbent on those, who defended the ancient aggregate character of
the Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from
the beginning.</p>

<p>To me it appears that the architectonic functions ascribed by
Wolf to Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric
poems, are nowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained
towards that view of the question, if it could be shown that, in
order to controvert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting
long written poems in the ninth century before the Christian era.
Few things, in my opinion, can be more improbable: and Mr. Payne
Knight, opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no
less than Wolf himself.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250"
class="fnanchor">[250]</a> The traces of writing in Greece, even
in the seventh century before the Christian era, are exceedingly
trifling. We have no remaining inscription earlier than the 40th
Olympiad, and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully
executed: nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus,
Simonidês of Amorgus, Kallinus, Tyrtæus, Xanthus, and the other early
elegiac and lyric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span>
poets, committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the
practice of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground,
which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of
Homer, is in the famous ordinance of Solôn with regard to the
rhapsodes at the Panathenæa; but for what length of time, previously,
manuscripts had existed, we are unable to say.</p>

<p>Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from
the beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs,—nor yet
upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetry, for
they admit generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but
recited and heard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there must
have been manuscripts,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251"
class="fnanchor">[251]</a> to insure the preservation of the
poems,—the unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient
nor trustworthy. But here we only escape a smaller difficulty by
running into a greater; for the existence of trained bards, gifted
with extraordinary memory, is far less astonishing than that of long
manuscripts in an age essentially non-reading and non-writing, and
when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not
obvious. Moreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing
that the bard was under no necessity for refreshing his memory by
consulting a manuscript. For if such had been the fact, blindness
would have been a disqualification for the profession, which we
know that it was not; as well from the example of Demodokus in the
Odyssey, as from that of the blind bard of Chios, in the hymn to
the Delian Apollo, whom Thucydidês, as well as the general tenor of
Grecian legend, identifies with Homer himself.<a id="FNanchor_252"
href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The author of
that Hymn, be he who he may, could never have described a<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p. 145]</span> blind man as attaining
the utmost perfection in his art, if he had been conscious that the
memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the
manuscript in his chest.</p>

<p>Nor will it be found, after all, that the effort of memory
required, either from bards or rhapsodes, even for the longest of
these old Epic poems,—though doubtless great, was at all superhuman.
Taking the case with reference to the entire Iliad and Odyssey, we
know that there were educated gentlemen at Athens who could repeat
both poems by heart:<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253"
class="fnanchor">[253]</a> but in the professional<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span> recitations, we are
not to imagine that the same person did go through the whole: the
recitation was essentially a joint undertaking, and the rhapsodes who
visited a festival would naturally understand among themselves which
part of the poem should devolve upon each particular individual.
Under such circumstances, and with such means of preparation
beforehand, the quantity of verse which a rhapsode could deliver
would be measured, not so much by the exhaustion of his memory, as
by the physical sufficiency of his voice, having reference to the
sonorous, emphatic, and rhythmical pronunciation required from him.<a
id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<p>But what guarantee have we for the exact transmission of the
text for a space of two centuries by simply oral means? It<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span> may be replied, that
oral transmission would hand down the text as exactly as in point
of fact it was handed down. The great lines of each poem,—the
order of parts,—the vein of Homeric feeling, and the general style
of locution, and, for the most part, the true words,—would be
maintained: for the professional training of the rhapsode, over and
above the precision of his actual memory, would tend to Homerize his
mind (if the expression may be permitted), and to restrain him within
this magic circle. On the other hand, in respect to the details of
the text, we should expect that there would be wide differences and
numerous inaccuracies: and so there really were, as the records
contained in the Scholia, together with the passages cited in ancient
authors, but not found in our Homeric text, abundantly testify.<a
id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the state of the Iliad and Odyssey, in respect to the
letter called the Digamma, affords a proof that they were recited
for a considerable period before they were committed to writing,
insomuch that the oral pronunciation underwent during the interval
a sensible change.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256"
class="fnanchor">[256]</a> At the time when these poems were
composed, the Digamma was an effective consonant, and figured as
such in the structure of the verse: at the time when they were<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span> committed to writing,
it had ceased to be pronounced, and therefore never found a place
in any of the manuscripts,—insomuch that the Alexandrine critics,
though they knew of its existence in the much later poems of Alkæus
and Sapphô, never recognized it in Homer. The hiatus, and the various
perplexities of metre, occasioned by the loss of the Digamma, were
corrected by different grammatical stratagems. But the whole history
of this lost letter is very curious, and is rendered intelligible
only by the supposition that the Iliad and Odyssey belonged for
a wide space of time to the memory, the voice, and the ear,
exclusively.</p>

<p>At what period these poems, or, indeed, any other Greek poems,
first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture, though
there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solôn.
If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon naming any more
determinate period, the question at once suggests itself, what were
the purposes which, in that stage of society, a manuscript at its
first commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was
a written Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it
was not only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the
feelings, and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and
intonations of voice, pauses, and other oral artifices, which were
required for emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript
could never reproduce. Not for the general public,—<i>they</i> were
accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with
its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival. The only
persons for whom the written Iliad would be suitable, would be a
select few; studious and curious men,—a class of readers, capable
of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced
as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the written
words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the
impression communicated by the reciter.<a id="FNanchor_257"
href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span></p> <p>Incredible as
the statement may seem in an age like the present, there is in all
early societies, and there was in early Greece, a time when no such
reading class existed. If we could discover at what time such a class
first began to be formed, we should be able to make a guess at the
time when the old Epic poems were first committed to writing. Now
the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as
having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading
class in Greece, is the middle of the seventh century before the
Christian era (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 660 to <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
630),—the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonidês of
Amorgus, etc. I ground this supposition on the change then operated
in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music,—the
elegiac and iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to
the primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been
transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real
life. Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only
known mode of publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether
suitable, yet the nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new
way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people, as well
as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p. 150]</span> thirst for
new poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it may well
be considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize,
from their own individual point of view, the written words of the
Homeric rhapsodes, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed
and eulogized the Thebaïs as the production of Homer. There seems,
therefore, ground for conjecturing, that (for the use of this
newly-formed and important, but very narrow class) manuscripts of the
Homeric poems and other old epics—the Thebaïs and the Cypria as well
as the Iliad and the Odyssey—began to be compiled towards the middle
of the seventh century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>:<a id="FNanchor_258"
href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and the opening of
Egypt to Grecian commerce, which took place about the same period,
would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite
papyrus to write upon. A reading class, when once formed, would
doubtless slowly increase, and the number of manuscripts along with
it; so that before the time of Solôn, fifty years afterwards, both
readers and manuscripts, though still comparatively few, might have
attained a certain recognized authority, and formed a tribunal of
reference, against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes.</p>

<p>We may, I think, consider the Iliad and Odyssey to have
been preserved without the aid of writing, for a period near
upon two centuries.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259"
class="fnanchor">[259]</a> But is it true, as Wolf imagined, and
as other able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span>
critics have imagined, also, that the separate portions of which
these two poems are composed were originally distinct epical ballads,
each constituting a separate whole and intended for separate
recitation? Is it true, that they had not only no common author, but
originally, neither common purpose nor fixed order, and that their
first permanent arrangement and integration was delayed for three
centuries, and accomplished at last only by the taste of Peisistratus
conjoined with various lettered friends?<a id="FNanchor_260"
href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p>This hypothesis—to which the genius of Wolf first gave celebrity,
but which has been since enforced more in detail by others,
especially by William Müller and Lachmann—appears to me not only
unsupported by any sufficient testimony, but also opposed to other
testimony as well as to a strong force of internal probability. The
authorities quoted by Wolf are Josephus, Cicero, and Pausanias:<a
id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
Josephus mentions nothing about Pei<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_152">[p. 152]</span>sistratus, but merely states (what
we may accept as the probable fact) that the Homeric poems were
originally unwritten, and preserved only in songs or recitations,
from which they were at a subsequent period put into writing: hence
many of the discrepancies in the text. On the other hand, Cicero and
Pausanias go farther, and affirm that Peisistratus both collected,
and arranged in the existing order, the rhapsodies of the Iliad and
Odyssey, (implied as poems originally entire, and subsequently broken
into pieces,) which he found partly confused and partly isolated from
each other,—each part being then remembered only in its own portion
of the Grecian world. Respecting Hipparchus the son of Peisistratus,
too, we are told in the Pseudo-Platonic dialogue which bears his
name, that he was the first to introduce into Attica, the poetry of
Homer, and that he prescribed to the rhapsodes to recite the parts
of the Panathenaic festival in regular sequence.<a id="FNanchor_262"
href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>Wolf and William Müller occasionally speak as if they admitted
something like an Iliad and Odyssey as established aggregates prior
to Peisistratus; but for the most part they represent him or his
associates as having been the first to put together Homeric poems
which were before distinct and self-existent compositions. And
Lachmann, the recent expositor of the same theory, ascribes to
Peisistratus still more unequivocally this original integration of
parts in reference to the Iliad,—distributing the first twenty-two
books of the poem into sixteen separate songs, and treating it as
ridiculous to imagine that the fusion of these songs, into an order
such as we now read, belongs to any date earlier than Peisistratus.<a
id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span></p> <p>Upon
this theory we may remark, first, that it stands opposed to the
testimony existing respecting the regulations of Solôn; who, before
the time of Peisistratus, had enforced a fixed order of recitation
on the rhapsodes of the Iliad at the Panathenaic festival; not only
directing that they should go through the rhapsodies <i>seriatim</i>, and
without omission or corruption, but also establishing a prompter
or censorial authority to insure obedience,<a id="FNanchor_264"
href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span>—which implies the existence (at
the same time that it proclaims the occasional infringement)
of an orderly aggregate, as well as of manuscripts professedly
complete. Next, the theory ascribes to Peisistratus a character
not only materially different from what is indicated by Cicero
and Pausanias,—who represent him, not as having put together
atoms originally distinct, but as the renovator of an ancient
order subsequently lost,—but also in itself unintelligible, and
inconsistent with Grecian habit and feeling. That Peisistratus should
take pains to repress the license, or make up for the unfaithful
memory, of individual rhapsodes, and to ennoble the Panathenaic
festival by the most correct recital of a great and venerable poem,
according to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p. 155]</span>
standard received among the best judges in Greece,—this is a task
both suitable to his position, and requiring nothing more than an
improved recension, together with exact adherence to it on the part
of the rhapsodes. But what motive had he to string together several
poems, previously known only as separate, into one new whole? What
feeling could he gratify by introducing the extensive changes and
transpositions surmised by Lachmann, for the purpose of binding
together sixteen songs, which the rhapsodes are assumed to have
been accustomed to recite, and the people to hear, each by itself
apart? Peisistratus was not a poet, seeking to interest the public
mind by new creations and combinations, but a ruler, desirous to
impart solemnity to a great religious festival in his native city.
Now such a purpose would be answered by selecting, amidst the
divergences of rhapsodes in different parts of Greece, that order
of text which intelligent men could approve as a return to the pure
and pristine Iliad; but it would be defeated if he attempted large
innovations of his own, and brought out for the first time a new
Iliad by blending together, altering, and transposing, many old and
well-known songs. A novelty so bold would have been more likely to
offend than to please both the critics and the multitude. And if it
were even enforced, by authority, at Athens, no probable reason can
be given why all the other towns, and all the rhapsodes throughout
Greece, should abnegate their previous habits in favor of it, since
Athens at that time enjoyed no political ascendency such as she
acquired during the following century. On the whole, it will appear
that the character and position of Peisistratus himself go far to
negative the function which Wolf and Lachmann put upon him. His
interference presupposes a certain foreknown and ancient aggregate,
the main lineaments of which were familiar to the Grecian public,
although many of the rhapsodes in their practice may have deviated
from it both by omission and interpolation. In correcting the
Athenian recitations conformably with such understood general type,
he might hope both to procure respect for Athens, and to constitute
a fashion for the rest of Greece. But this step of “collecting the
torn body of sacred Homer,” is something generically different
from the composition of a new Iliad out of preëxisting songs<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span> the former is as easy,
suitable, and promising, as the latter is violent and gratuitous.<a
id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>To sustain the inference, that Peisistratus was the first
architect of the Iliad and Odyssey, it ought at least to be shown
that no other long and continuous poems existed during the earlier
centuries. But the contrary of this is known to be the fact. The
Æthiopis of Arktinus, which contained nine thousand one hundred
verses, dates from a period more than two centuries earlier than
Peisistratus: several other of the lost cyclic epics, some among
them of considerable length, appear during the century succeeding
Arktinus; and it is important to notice that three or four at
least of these poems passed currently under the name of Homer.<a
id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
There is no greater intrinsic difficulty in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_157">[p. 157]</span> supposing long epics to have begun
with the Iliad and Odyssey than with the Æthiopis: the ascendency
of the name of Homer and the subordinate position of Arktinus, in
the history of early Grecian poetry, tend to prove the former in
preference to the latter.</p>

<p>Moreover, we find particular portions of the Iliad, which
expressly pronounce themselves, by their own internal evidence,
as belonging to a large whole, and not as separate integers. We
can hardly conceive the Catalogue in the second book, except as a
fractional composition, and with reference to a series of approaching
exploits; for, taken apart by itself, such a barren enumeration of
names could have stimulated neither the fancy of the poet, nor the
attention of the listeners. But the Homeric Catalogue had acquired
a sort of canonical authority even in the time of Solôn, insomuch
that he interpolated a line into it, or was accused of doing so,
for the purpose of gaining a disputed point against the Megarians,
who, on their side, set forth another version.<a id="FNanchor_267"
href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> No such established
reverence could have been felt for this document, unless there had
existed for a long time prior to Peisistratus, the habit of regarding
and listening to the Iliad as a continuous poem. And when the
philosopher Xenophanês, contemporary with Peisistratus, noticed Homer
as the universal teacher, and denounced him as an unworthy describer
of the gods, he must have connected this great mental sway, not with
a number of unconnected rhapsodies, but with an aggregate Iliad
and Odyssey; probably with other poems, also, ascribed to the same
author, such as the Cypria, Epigoni, and Thebaïs.</p>

<p>We find, it is true, references in various authors to portions of
the Iliad, each by its own separate name, such as the Teichomachy,
the Aristeia (preëminent exploits) of Diomedês, or Agamemnôn, the
Doloneia, or Night-expedition (of Dolon as well<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span> as of Odysseus and Diomedês), etc.,
and hence, it has been concluded, that these portions originally
existed as separate poems, before they were cemented together into
an Iliad. But such references prove nothing to the point; for until
the Iliad was divided by Aristarchus and his colleagues into a
given number of books, or rhapsodies, designated by the series of
letters in the alphabet, there was no method of calling attention
to any particular portion of the poem except by special indication
of its subject-matter.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268"
class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Authors subsequent to Peisistratus, such
as Herodotus and Plato, who unquestionably conceived the Iliad as
a whole, cite the separate fractions of it by designations of this
sort.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks on the Wolfian hypothesis respecting the
text of the Iliad, tend to separate two points which are by no
means necessarily connected, though that hypothesis, as set forth
by Wolf himself, by W. Müller, and by Lachmann, presents the two in
conjunction. First, was the Iliad originally projected and composed
by one author, and as one poem, or were the different parts composed
separately and by unconnected authors, and subsequently strung
together into an aggregate? Secondly, assuming that the internal
evidences of the poem negative the former supposition, and drive us
upon the latter, was the construction of the whole poem deferred,
and did the parts exist only in their separate state, until a period
so late as the reign of Peisistratus? It is obvious that these two
questions are essentially separate, and that a man may believe the
Iliad to have been put together out of preëxisting songs, without
recognizing the age of Peisistratus as the period of its first
compilation. Now, whatever may be the steps through which the poem
passed to its ultimate integrity, there is sufficient reason for
believing that they had been accomplished long before that period:
the friends of Peisistratus found an Iliad already existing and
already ancient in their time, even granting that the poem had not
been originally born in a state of unity. Moreover, the Alexandrine
critics, whose remarks are preserved in the Scholia, do not even
notice the Peisistratic recension among the many manuscripts<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span> which they had
before them: and Mr. Payne Knight justly infers from their silence
that either they did not possess it, or it was in their eyes of
no great authority;<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269"
class="fnanchor">[269]</a> which could never have been the case if it
had been the prime originator of Homeric unity.</p>

<p>The line of argument, by which the advocates of Wolf’s hypothesis
negative the primitive unity of the poem, consists in exposing gaps,
incongruities, contradictions, etc., between the separate parts.
Now, if in spite of all these incoherences, standing mementos of
an antecedent state of separation, the component poems were made
to coalesce so intimately as to appear as if they had been one
from the beginning, we can better understand the complete success
of the proceeding and the universal prevalence of the illusion,
by supposing such coalescence to have taken place at a very early
period, during the productive days of epical genius, and before the
growth of reading and criticism. The longer the aggregation of the
separate poems was deferred, the harder it would be to obliterate
in men’s minds the previous state of separation, and to make them
accept the new aggregate as an original unity. The bards or rhapsodes
might have found comparatively little difficulty in thus piecing
together distinct songs, during the ninth or eighth century before
Christ;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span> but it
we suppose the process to be deferred until the latter half of the
sixth century,—if we imagine that Solôn, with all his contemporaries
and predecessors, knew nothing about any aggregate Iliad, but was
accustomed to read and hear only those sixteen distinct epical
pieces into which Lachmann would dissect the Iliad, each of the
sixteen bearing a separate name of its own,—no compilation then
for the first time made by the friends of Peisistratus could have
effaced the established habit, and planted itself in the general
convictions of Greece as the primitive Homeric production. Had the
sixteen pieces remained disunited and individualized down to the time
of Peisistratus, they would in all probability have continued so
ever afterwards; nor could the extensive changes and transpositions
which (according to Lachmann’s theory) were required to melt them
down into our present Iliad, have obtained at that late period
universal acceptance. Assuming it to be true that such changes and
transpositions did really take place, they must at least be referred
to a period greatly earlier than Peisistratus or Solôn.</p>

<p>The whole tenor of the poems themselves confirms what is here
remarked. There is nothing either in the Iliad or Odyssey which
savors of <i>modernism</i>, applying that term to the age of Peisistratus;
nothing which brings to our view the alterations, brought about by
two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined money, the habits
of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican governments,
the close military array, the improved construction of ships, the
Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of religious
festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, etc.,
familiar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus and the
other literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed
to notice even without design, had they then for the first time
undertaken the task of piecing together many self-existent epics
into one large aggregate.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270"
class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Everything in the two great Homeric
poems, both in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span>
substance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries
earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or
those passages which on the best grounds are pronounced to be
such) betray no trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may
well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinus,—in some cases
even by Arktinus and Hesiod,—as genuine Homeric matter. As far as
the evidences on the case, as well internal as external, enable
us to judge, we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and
Odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand, (always
allowing for partial divergences of text, and interpolations,)
in 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, our first trustworthy mark of
Grecian time. And this ancient date,—let it be added,—as it is the
best-authenticated fact, so it is also the most important attribute
of the Homeric poems, considered in reference to Grecian history. For
they thus afford us an insight into the ante-historical character of
the Greeks,—enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the
nation, and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and
their later condition.</p>

<p>Rejecting, therefore, the idea of compilation by Peisistratus,
and referring the present state of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period
more than two centuries earlier, the question still remains, by what
process, or through whose agency, they reached that state? Is each
poem the work of one author, or of several? If the latter, do all the
parts belong to the same age? What ground is there for believing,
that any or all of these parts existed before, as separate poems, and
have been accommodated to the place in which they now appear, by more
or less systematic alteration?</p>

<p>The acute and valuable Prolegomena of Wolf, half a century ago,
powerfully turned the attention of scholars to the necessity of
considering the Iliad and Odyssey with reference to the age and
society in which they arose, and to the material differences in this
respect between Homer and more recent epic poets.<a id="FNanchor_271"
href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span> Since that time, an elaborate study has
been bestowed upon the early manifestations of poetry (Sagen-poesie)
among other nations; and the German critics especially, among
whom this description of literatures has been most cultivated,
have selected it as the only appropriate analogy for the Homeric
poems. Such poetry, consisting for the most part of short, artless
effusions, with little of deliberate or far-sighted combination, has
been assumed by many critics as a fit standard to apply for measuring
the capacities of the Homeric age; an age exclusively of speakers,
singers, and hearers, not of readers or writers. In place of the
unbounded admiration which was felt for Homer, not merely as a poet
of detail, but as constructor of a long epic, at the time when Wolf
wrote his Prolegomena, the tone of criticism passed to the opposite
extreme, and attention was fixed entirely upon the defects in the
arrangement of the Iliad and Odyssey. Whatever was to be found in
them of symmetry or pervading system, was pronounced to be decidedly
post-Homeric. Under such preconceived anticipations, Homer seems
to have been generally studied in Germany, during the generation
succeeding Wolf, the negative portion of whose theory was usually
admitted, though as to the positive substitute,—what explanation was
to be given of the history and present constitution of the Homeric
poems,—there was by no means the like agreement. During the last
ten years, however, a contrary tendency has manifested itself; the
Wolfian theory has been reëxamined and shaken by Nitzsch, who, as
well as O. Müller, Welcker, and other scholars, have revived the idea
of original Homeric unity, under certain modifications. The change
in Goethe’s opinion, coincident with this new direction, is recorded
in one of his latest works.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272"
class="fnanchor">[272]</a> On the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span> other hand, the original opinion
of Wolf has also been reproduced within the last five years, and
fortified with several new observations on the text of the Iliad, by
Lachmann.</p>

<p>The point is thus still under controversy among able scholars,
and is probably destined to remain so. For, in truth, our means
of knowledge are so limited, that no man can produce arguments
sufficiently cogent to contend against opposing preconceptions;
and it creates a painful sentiment of diffidence when we read the
expressions of equal and absolute persuasion with which the two
opposite conclusions have both been advanced.<a id="FNanchor_273"
href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> We have nothing to
teach us the history of these poems except the poems themselves. Not
only do we possess no collateral information<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span> respecting them or their authors, but
we have no one to describe to us the people or the age in which they
originated; our knowledge respecting contemporary Homeric society, is
collected exclusively from the Homeric compositions themselves. We
are ignorant whether any other, or what other, poems preceded them,
or divided with them the public favor; nor have we anything better
than conjecture to determine either the circumstances under which
they were brought before the hearers, or the conditions which a bard
of that day was required to satisfy. On all these points, moreover,
the age of Thucydidês<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274"
class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and Plato seems to have been no better
informed than we are, except in so far as they could profit by the
analogies of the cyclic and other epic poems, which would doubtless
in many cases have afforded valuable aid.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, no classical scholar can be easy without <i>some</i>
opinion respecting the authorship of these immortal poems. And the
more defective the evidence we possess, the more essential is it
that all that evidence should be marshalled in the clearest order,
and its bearing upon the points in controversy distinctly understood
beforehand. Both these conditions seem to have been often neglected,
throughout the long-continued Homeric discussion.</p>

<p>To illustrate the first point: Since two poems are comprehended
in the problem to be solved, the natural process would be, first, to
study the easier of the two, and then to apply the conclusions thence
deduced as a means of explaining the other. Now, the Odyssey, looking
at its aggregate character, is incomparably more easy to comprehend
than the Iliad. Yet most Homeric critics apply the microscope at
once, and in the first instance, to the Iliad.</p>

<p>To illustrate the second point: What evidence is sufficient
to negative the supposition that the Iliad or the Odyssey is a
poem originally and intentionally one? Not simply particular
gaps and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span>
contradictions, though they be even gross and numerous; but the
preponderance of these proofs of mere unprepared coalescence over the
other proofs of designed adaptation scattered throughout the whole
poem. For the poet (or the coöperating poets, if more than one) may
have intended to compose an harmonious whole, but may have realized
their intention incompletely, and left partial faults; or, perhaps,
the contradictory lines may have crept in through a corrupt text. A
survey of the whole poem is necessary to determine the question; and
this necessity, too, has not always been attended to.</p>

<p>If it had happened that the Odyssey had been preserved to
us alone, without the Iliad, I think the dispute respecting
Homeric unity would never have been raised. For the former is,
in my judgment, pervaded almost from beginning to end by marks
of designed adaptation; and the special faults which Wolf, W.
Müller, and B. Thiersch,<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275"
class="fnanchor">[275]</a> have singled out for the purpose of
disproving such unity of intention, are so few, and of so little
importance, that they would have been universally regarded as mere
instances of haste or unskilfulness on the part of the poet, had
they not been seconded by the far more powerful battery opened
against the Iliad. These critics, having laid down their general
presumptions against the antiquity of the long epopee, illustrate
their principles by exposing the many flaws and fissures in the
Iliad, and then think it sufficient if they can show a few similar
defects in the Odyssey,—as if the breaking up of Homeric unity in
the former naturally entailed a similar necessity with regard to the
latter; and their method of proceeding, contrary to the rule above
laid down, puts the more difficult problem in the foreground, as a
means of solution for the easier. We can hardly wonder, however, that
they have applied their observations in the first instance to the
Iliad, because it is in every man’s esteem the more marked, striking,
and impressive poem of the two,—and the character of Homer is more
intimately identified with it than with the Odyssey. This may serve
as an explanation of the course pursued; but be the case as it may in
respect to comparative poetical merit, it is not the less true, that,
as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span> aggregate,
the Odyssey is more simple and easily understood, and, therefore,
ought to come first in the order of analysis.</p>

<p>Now, looking at the Odyssey by itself, the proofs of an unity of
design seem unequivocal and everywhere to be found. A premeditated
structure, and a concentration of interest upon one prime hero, under
well-defined circumstances, may be traced from the first book to the
twenty-third. Odysseus is always either directly or indirectly kept
before the reader, as a warrior returning from the fulness of glory
at Troy, exposed to manifold and protracted calamities during his
return home, on which his whole soul is so bent that he refuses even
the immortality offered by Calypsô;—a victim, moreover, even after
his return, to mingled injury and insult from the suitors, who have
long been plundering his property, and dishonoring his house; but
at length obtaining, by valor and cunning united, a signal revenge,
which restores him to all that he had lost. All the persons and all
the events in the poem are subsidiary to this main plot: and the
divine agency, necessary to satisfy the feeling of the Homeric man,
is put forth by Poseidôn and Athênê, in both cases from dispositions
directly bearing upon Odysseus. To appreciate the unity of the
Odyssey, we have only to read the objections taken against that of
the Iliad,—especially in regard to the long withdrawal of Achilles,
not only from the scene, but from the memory,—together with the
independent prominence of Ajax, Diomêdês, and other heroes. How
far we are entitled from hence to infer the want of premeditated
unity in the Iliad, will be presently considered; but it is certain
that the constitution of the Odyssey, in this respect, everywhere
demonstrates the presence of such unity. Whatever may be the interest
attached to Penelopê, Telemachus, or Eumæus, we never disconnect
them from their association with Odysseus. The present is not the
place for collecting the many marks of artistical structure dispersed
throughout this poem; but it may be worth while to remark, that the
final catastrophe realized in the twenty-second book,—the slaughter
of the suitors in the very house which they were profaning,—is
distinctly and prominently marked out in the first and second books,
promised by Teiresias in the eleventh, by Athênê in the thirteenth,
and by Helen in the fifteenth, and gradually matured by a series
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span> suitable
preliminaries, throughout the eight books preceding its occurrence.<a
id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
Indeed, what is principally evident, and what has been often noticed,
in the Odyssey, is, the equable flow both of the narrative and the
events; the absence of that rise and fall of interest which is
sufficiently conspicuous in the Iliad.</p>

<p>To set against these evidences of unity, there ought, at
least, to be some strong cases produced of occasional incoherence
or contradiction. But it is remarkable how little of such
counter-evidence is to be found, although the arguments of Wolf,
W. Müller, and B. Thiersch stand so much in need of it. They have
discovered only one instance of undeniable inconsistency in the
parts,—the number of days occupied by the absence of Telemachus at
Pylus and Sparta. That young prince, though represented as in great
haste to depart, and refusing pressing invitations to prolong his
stay, must, nevertheless, be supposed to have continued for thirty
days the guest of Menelaus, in order to bring his proceedings into
chronological harmony with those of Odysseus, and to explain the
first meeting of father and son in the swine-fold of Eumæus. Here
is undoubtedly an inaccuracy, (so Nitzsch<a id="FNanchor_277"
href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> treats it, and I
think justly) on the part of the poet, who did not anticipate,
and did not experience in ancient times, so strict a scrutiny; an
inaccuracy certainly not at all wonderful; the matter of real wonder
is, that it stands almost alone, and that there are no others in the
poem.</p>

<p>Now, this is one of the main points on which W. Müller and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p. 168]</span> B. Thiersch rest their
theory,—explaining the chronological confusion by supposing that the
journey of Telemachus to Pylus and Sparta, constituted the subject
of an epic originally separate (comprising the first four books
and a portion of the fifteenth), and incorporated at second-hand
with the remaining poem. And they conceive this view to be farther
confirmed by the double assembly of the gods, (at the beginning of
the first book as well as of the fifth,) which they treat as an
awkward repetition, such as could not have formed part of the primary
scheme of any epic poet. But here they only escape a small difficulty
by running into another and a greater. For it is impossible to
comprehend how the first four books and part of the fifteenth can
ever have constituted a distinct epic; since the adventures of
Telemachus have no satisfactory termination, except at the point of
confluence with those of his father, when the unexpected meeting and
recognition takes place under the roof of Eumæus,—nor can any epic
poem ever have described that meeting and recognition without giving
some account how Odysseus came thither. Moreover, the first two books
of the Odyssey distinctly lay the ground, and carry expectation
forward, to the final catastrophe of the poem,—treating Telemachus
as a subordinate person, and his expedition as merely provisional
towards an ulterior result. Nor can I agree with W. Müller, that the
real Odyssey might well be supposed to begin with the fifth book.
On the contrary, the exhibition of the suitors and the Ithakesian
agora, presented to us in the second book, is absolutely essential
to the full comprehension of the books subsequent to the thirteenth.
The suitors are far too important personages in the poem to allow
of their being first introduced in so informal a manner as we read
in the sixteenth book: indeed, the passing allusions of Athênê
(xiii. 310, 375) and Eumæus (xiv. 41, 81) to the suitors, presuppose
cognizance of them on the part of the hearer.</p>

<p>Lastly, the twofold discussion of the gods, at the beginning of
the first and fifth books, and the double interference of Athênê,
far from being a needless repetition, may be shown to suit perfectly
both the genuine epical conditions and the unity of the poem.<a
id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
For although the final consummation, and the organiza<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span>tion of measures against
the suitors, was to be accomplished by Odysseus and Telemachus
jointly, yet the march and adventures of the two, until the moment of
their meeting in the dwelling of Eumæus, were essentially distinct.
But, according to the religious ideas of the old epic, the presiding
direction of Athênê was necessary for the safety and success of both
of them. Her first interference arouses and inspires the son, her
second produces the liberation of the father,—constituting a point
of union and common origination for two lines of adventures, in both
of which she takes earnest interest, but which are necessarily for a
time kept apart in order to coincide at the proper moment.</p>

<p>It will thus appear that the twice-repeated agora of the gods in
the Odyssey, bringing home, as it does to one and the same divine
agent, that double start which is essential to the scheme of the
poem, consists better with the supposition of premeditated unity
than with that of distinct self-existent parts. And, assuredly, the
manner in which Telemachus and Odysseus, both by different roads,
are brought into meeting and conjunction at the dwelling of Eumæus,
is something not only contrived, but very skilfully contrived. It is
needless to advert to the highly interesting character of Eumæus,
rendered available as a rallying-point, though in different ways,
both to the father and the son, over and above the sympathy which he
himself inspires.</p>

<p>If the Odyssey be not an original unity, of what self-existent
parts can we imagine it to have consisted? To this question it is
difficult to imagine a satisfactory reply: for the supposition that
Telemachus and his adventures may once have formed the subject of a
separate epos, apart from Odysseus, appears inconsistent with the
whole character of that youth as it stands in the poem, and with the
events in which he is made to take part. We could better imagine
the distribution of the adventures of Odysseus himself into two
parts,—one containing his wanderings and return, the other handling
his ill-treatment by the suitors, and his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_170">[p. 170]</span> final triumph. But though either of
these two subjects might have been adequate to furnish out a separate
poem, it is nevertheless certain that, as they are presented in the
Odyssey, the former cannot be divorced from the latter. The simple
return of Odysseus, as it now stands in the poem, could satisfy no
one as a final close, so long as the suitors remain in possession
of his house, and forbid his reunion with his wife. Any poem which
treated his wanderings and return separately, must have represented
his reunion with Penelopê and restoration to his house, as following
naturally upon his arrival in Ithaka,—thus taking little or no
notice of the suitors. But this would be a capital mutilation of
the actual epical narrative, which considers the suitors at home as
an essential portion of the destiny of the much-suffering hero, not
less than his shipwrecks and trials at sea. His return (separately
taken) is foredoomed, according to the curse of Polyphemus, executed
by Poseidôn, to be long deferred, miserable, solitary, and ending
with destruction in his house to greet him;<a id="FNanchor_279"
href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and the ground is
thus laid, in the very recital of his wanderings, for a new series
of events which are to happen to him after his arrival in Ithaka.
There is no tenable halting-place between the departure of Odysseus
from Troy, and the final restoration to his house and his wife.
The distance between these two events may, indeed, be widened, by
accumulating new distresses and impediments, but any separate portion
of it cannot be otherwise treated than as a fraction of the whole.
The beginning and the end are here the data in respect to epical
genesis, though the intermediate events admit of being conceived as
variables, more or less numerous: so that the conception of the whole
may be said without impropriety both to precede and to govern that of
the constituent parts.</p>

<p>The general result of a study of the Odyssey may be set down
as follows: 1. The poem, as it now stands, exhibits unequivocally
adaptation of parts and continuity of structure, whether by one or
by several consentient hands: it may, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span> be a secondary formation, out of a
preëxisting Odyssey of smaller dimensions; but, if so, the parts
of the smaller whole must have been so far recast as to make them
suitable members of the larger, and are noway recognizable by us.
2. The subject-matter of the poem not only does not favor, but goes
far to exclude, the possibility of the Wolfian hypothesis. Its
events cannot be so arranged as to have composed several antecedent
substantive epics, afterwards put together into the present
aggregate. Its authors cannot have been mere compilers of preëxisting
materials, such as Peisistratus and his friends: they must have been
poets, competent to work such matter as they found, into a new and
enlarged design of their own. Nor can the age in which this long
poem, of so many thousand lines, was turned out as a continuous
aggregate, be separated from the ancient, productive, inspired age of
Grecian epic.</p>

<p>Arriving at such conclusions from the internal evidence
of the Odyssey,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280"
class="fnanchor">[280]</a> we can apply them by analogy to the Iliad.
We learn something respecting the character and capacities of that
early age which has left no other mementos except these two poems.
Long continuous epics (it is observed by those who support the views
of Wolf), with an artistical structure, are inconsistent with the
capacities of a rude and non-writing age. Such epics (we may reply)
are <i>not inconsistent</i> with the early age of the Greeks, and the
Odyssey is a proof of it; for in that poem the integration of the
whole, and the composition of the parts, must have been simultaneous.
The analogy of the Odyssey enables us to rebut that preconception
under which many ingenious critics sit down to the study of the
Iliad, and which induces them to explain all the incoherences of the
latter by breaking it up into smaller unities, as if short epics were
the only manifestation of poetical power which the age admitted.
There ought to be no reluctance in admitting a presiding scheme and
premeditated unity of parts, in so far as the parts themselves point
to such a conclusion.</p> <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p.
172]</span></p> <p>That the Iliad is not so essentially one piece
as the Odyssey, every man agrees. It includes a much greater
multiplicity of events, and what is yet more important, a greater
multiplicity of prominent personages: the very indefinite title which
it bears, as contrasted with the speciality of the name, <i>Odyssey</i>,
marks the difference at once. The parts stand out more conspicuously
from the whole, and admit more readily of being felt and appreciated
in detached recitation. We may also add, that it is of more unequal
execution than the Odyssey,—often rising to a far higher pitch of
grandeur, but also, occasionally, tamer: the story does not move on
continuously; incidents occur without plausible motive, nor can we
shut our eyes to evidences of incoherence and contradiction.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, the Iliad is open to all these remarks,
though Wolf and William Müller, and above all Lachmann, exaggerate
the case in degree. And from hence has been deduced the hypothesis
which treats the parts in their original state as separate integers,
independent of, and unconnected with, each other, and forced into
unity only by the afterthought of a subsequent age; or sometimes, not
even themselves as integers, but as aggregates grouped together out
of fragments still smaller,—short epics formed by the coalescence
of still shorter songs. Now there is some plausibility in these
reasonings, so long as the discrepancies are looked upon as the
whole of the case. But in point of fact they are not the whole of
the case: for it is not less true, that there are large portions
of the Iliad which present positive and undeniable evidences of
coherence as antecedent and consequent, though we are occasionally
perplexed by inconsistencies of detail. To deal with these latter,
is a portion of the duties of the critic. But he is not to treat the
Iliad as if inconsistency prevailed everywhere throughout its parts;
for coherence of parts—symmetrical antecedence and consequence—is
discernible throughout the larger half of the poem.</p>

<p>Now the Wolfian theory explains the gaps and contradictions
throughout the narrative, but it explains nothing else. If (as
Lachmann thinks) the Iliad originally consisted of sixteen
songs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span> or little
substantive epics, (Lachmann’s sixteen songs cover the space only
as far as the 22d book, or the death of Hector, and two more songs
would have to be admitted for the 23d and 24th books),—not only
composed by different authors, but by each<a id="FNanchor_281"
href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> without any view
to conjunction with the rest,—we have then no right to expect any
intrinsic continuity between them; and all that continuity which we
now find must be of extraneous origin. Where are we to look for the
origin? Lachmann follows Wolf, in ascribing the whole constructive
process to Peisistratus and his associates, at a period when the
creative epical faculty is admitted to have died out. But upon this
supposition, Peisistratus (or his associates) must have done much
more than omit, transpose, and interpolate, here and there; he must
have gone far to rewrite the whole poem. A great poet might have
recast preëxisting separate songs into one comprehensive whole, but
no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so: and we
are thus left without any means of accounting for that degree of
continuity and consistence which runs through so large a portion of
the Iliad, though not through the whole. The idea that the poem,
as we read it, grew out of atoms not originally designed for the
places which they now occupy, involves us in new and inextricable
difficulties, when we seek to elucidate either the mode of
coalescence or the degree of existing unity.<a id="FNanchor_282"
href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span>Admitting then
premeditated adaptation of parts to a certain extent as essential to
the Iliad, we may yet inquire, whether it was produced all at once,
or gradually enlarged,—whether by one author, or by several; and, if
the parts be of different age, which is the primitive kernel, and
which are the additions.</p>

<p>Welcker, Lange, and Nitzsch<a id="FNanchor_283"
href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> treat the Homeric
poems as representing a second step in advance, in the progress
of popular poetry. First, comes the age of short narrative songs;
next, when these have become numerous, there arise constructive
minds, who recast and blend together many of them into a larger
aggregate, conceived upon some scheme of their own. The age of the
epos is followed by that of the epopee,—short, spontaneous effusions
preparing the way, and furnishing materials, for the architectonic
genius of the poet. It is farther presumed by the above-mentioned
authors, that the pre-Homeric epic included a great abundance of
such smaller songs,—a fact which admits of no proof, but which seems
countenanced by some passages in Homer, and is in itself no way
improbable. But the transition from such songs, assuming them to be
ever so numerous, to a combined and continuous poem, forms an epoch
in the intellectual history of the nation, implying mental qualities
of a higher order than those upon which the songs themselves depend.
Nor is it to be imagined that the materials pass unaltered from their
first state of isolation into their second state of combination. They
must of necessity be recast, and undergo an adapting process, in
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span> the genius
of the organizing poet consists; nor can we hope, by simply knowing
them as they exist in the second stage, ever to divine how they stood
in the first. Such, in my judgment, is the right conception of the
Homeric epoch,—an organizing poetical mind, still preserving that
freshness of observation and vivacity of details which constitutes
the charm of the ballad.</p>

<p>Nothing is gained by studying the Iliad as a congeries of
fragments once independent of each other: no portion of the poem
can be shown to have ever been so, and the supposition introduces
difficulties greater than those which it removes. But it is
not necessary to affirm that the whole poem as we now read it,
belonged to the original and preconceived plan.<a id="FNanchor_284"
href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> In this respect,
the Iliad produces, upon my mind, an impression totally different
from the Odyssey. In the latter poem, the characters and incidents
are fewer, and the whole plot appears of one projection, from the
beginning down to the death of the suitors: none of the parts look
as if they had been composed separately, and inserted by way of
addition into a preëxisting smaller poem. But the Iliad, on the
contrary, presents the appearance of a house built upon a plan
comparatively narrow, and subsequently enlarged by successive
additions. The first book, together with the eighth, and the books
from the eleventh to the twenty-second, inclusive, seem to form the
primary organization of the poem, then properly an Achillêis: the
twenty-third and twenty-fourth books are, perhaps, additions at
the tail of this primitive poem, which still leave it nothing more
than an enlarged Achillêis. But the books from the second to the
seventh, inclusive, together with the tenth, are of a wider and more
comprehensive character, and convert the poem<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span> from an Achillêis into an Iliad.<a
id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
The primitive frontispiece, inscribed with the anger of Achilles,
and its direct consequences, yet remains, after it has ceased to
be coextensive with the poem. The parts added, however, are not
necessarily inferior in merit to the original poem: so far is this
from being the case, that amongst them are comprehended some of the
noblest efforts of the Grecian epic. Nor are they more recent in date
than the original; strictly speaking, they must be a little more
recent, but they belong to the same generation and state of society
as the primitive Achillêis. These qualifications are necessary to
keep apart different questions, which, in discussions of Homeric
criticism, are but too often confounded.</p>

<p>If we take those portions of the poem which I imagine to have
constituted the original Achillêis, it will be found that the
sequence of events contained in them is more rapid, more unbroken,
and more intimately knit together in the way of cause and effect,
than in the other books. Heyne and Lachmann, indeed, with other
objecting critics, complains of the action in them as being too much
crowded and hurried, since one day lasts from the beginning of the
eleventh book to the middle of the eighteenth, without any sensible
halt in the march throughout so large a portion of the journey.
Lachmann, likewise, admits that those separate songs, into which he
imagines that the whole Iliad may be dissected, cannot be severed
with the same sharpness, in the books subsequent to the eleventh,
as in those before it.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286"
class="fnanchor">[286]</a> There is only one<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span> real halting-place from the eleventh
book to the twenty-second,—the death of Patroclus; and this can never
be conceived as the end of a separate poem,<a id="FNanchor_287"
href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> though it is a
capital step in the development of the Achillêis, and brings about
that entire revolution in the temper of Achilles which was essential
for the purpose of the poet. It would be a mistake to imagine that
there ever could have existed a separate poem called Patrocleia,
though a part of the Iliad was designated by that name. For Patroclus
has no substantive position: he is the attached friend and second of
Achilles, but nothing else,—standing to the latter in a relation of
dependence resembling that of Telemachus to Odysseus. And the way in
which Patroclus is dealt with in the Iliad, is, (in my judgment,)
the most dexterous and artistical contrivance in the poem,—that
which approaches nearest to the neat tissue of the Odyssey.<a
id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span>The great and
capital misfortune which prostrates the strength of the Greeks, and
renders them incapable of defending themselves without Achilles, is
the disablement, by wounds, of Agamemnôn, Diomêdês, and Odysseus; so
that the defence of the wall and of the ships is left only to heroes
of the second magnitude (Ajax alone excepted), such as Idomeneus,
Leonteus, Polypœtês, Merionês, Menelaus, etc. Now, it is remarkable
that all these three first-rate chiefs are in full force at the
beginning of the eleventh book: all three are wounded in the battle
which that book describes, and at the commencement of which Agamemnôn
is full of spirits and courage.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more striking than the manner in which Homer
concentrates our attention in the first book upon Achilles as
the hero, his quarrel with Agamemnôn, and the calamities to the
Greeks which are held out as about to ensue from it, through the
intercession of Thetis with Zeus. But the incidents dwelt upon from
the beginning of the second book down to the combat between Hector
and Ajax in the seventh, animated and interesting as they are, do
nothing to realize this promise. They are a splendid picture of the
Trojan war generally, and eminently suitable to that larger title
under which the poem has been immortalized,—but the consequences of
the anger of Achilles do not appear until the eighth book. The tenth
book, or Doloneia, is also a portion of the Iliad, but not of the
Achillêis: while the ninth book appears to me a subsequent addition,
nowise harmonizing with that main stream of the Achillêis which flows
from the eleventh book to the twenty-second. The eighth book ought
to be read in immediate connection with the eleventh, in order to
see the structure of what seems the primitive Achillêis; for there
are several passages in the eleventh and the following books, which
prove that the poet who composed them could not have had present to
his mind the main event of the ninth book,—the outpouring of profound
humiliation by the Greeks, and from Agamemnôn, especially, before
Achilles, coupled with formal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p.
179]</span> offers to restore Brisêis, and pay the amplest
compensation for past wrong.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289"
class="fnanchor">[289]</a> The words of Achilles (not less than those
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span> Patroclus
and Nestor) in the eleventh and in the following books, plainly
imply that the humiliation of the Greeks before him, for<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p. 181]</span> which he thirsts, is
as yet future and contingent; that no plenary apology has yet been
tendered, nor any offer made of restoring<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_182">[p. 182]</span> Brisêis; while both Nestor and
Patroclus, with all their wish to induce him to take arms, never take
notice of the offered atonement and restitution, but view him as one
whose ground for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span>
quarrel stands still the same as it did at the beginning. Moreover,
if we look at the first book,—the opening of the Achillêis,—we shall
see that this prostration of Agamemnôn and the chief Grecian heroes
before Achilles, would really be the termination of the whole poem;
for Achilles asks nothing more from Thetis, nor Thetis anything more
from Zeus, than that Agamemnôn and the Greeks may be brought to know
the wrong they have done to their capital warrior, and humbled in the
dust in expiation of it. We may add, that the abject terror in which
Agamemnôn appears in the ninth book, when he sends the supplicatory
message to Achilles, as it is not adequately accounted for by the
degree of calamity which the Greeks have experienced in the preceding
(eighth) book, so it is inconsistent with the gallantry and high
spirit with which he shines at the beginning of the eleventh.<a
id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> The
situation of the Greeks only becomes desperate when the three great
chiefs, Agamemnôn, Odysseus, and Diomêdês, are disabled by wounds;<a
id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
this is the irreparable calamity which works upon Patroclus, and
through him upon Achilles. The ninth book, as it now stands, seems
to me an addition, by a different hand, to the original Achillêis,
framed so as both to forestall and to spoil the nineteenth book,
which is the real reconciliation of the two inimical heroes: I will
venture to add, that it carries the pride and egotism of Achilles
beyond even the largest exigences of insulted honor, and is shocking
to that sentiment of Nemesis which was so deeply seated in the
Grecian mind. We forgive any excess of fury against the Trojans and
Hector, after the death of Patroclus; but that he should remain
unmoved by restitution, by abject supplications, and by the richest
atoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span> presents,
tendered from the Greeks, indicates an implacability such as neither
the first book, nor the books between the eleventh and seventeenth,
convey.</p>

<p>It is with the Grecian agora, in the beginning of the second
book, that the Iliad (as distinguished from the Achillêis)
commences,—continued through the Catalogue, the muster of the two
armies, the single combat between Menelaus and Paris, the renewed
promiscuous battle caused by the arrow of Pandarus, the (Epipôlêsis,
or) personal circuit of Agamemnôn round the army, the Aristeia, or
brilliant exploits of Diomêdês, the visit of Hector to Troy for
the purposes of sacrifice, his interview with Andromachê, and his
combat with Ajax,—down to the seventh book. All these are beautiful
poetry, presenting to us the general Trojan war, and its conspicuous
individuals under different points of view, but leaving no room in
the reader’s mind for the thought of Achilles. Now, the difficulty
for an enlarging poet, was, to pass from the Achillêis in the
first book, to the Iliad in the second, and it will accordingly be
found that here is an awkwardness in the structure of the poem,
which counsel on the poet’s behalf (ancient or modern) do not
satisfactorily explain.</p>

<p>In the first book, Zeus has promised Thetis, that he will punish
the Greeks for the wrong done to Achilles: in the beginning of the
second book, he deliberates how he shall fulfil the promise, and
sends down for that purpose “mischievous Oneirus” (the Dream-god)
to visit Agamemnôn in his sleep, to assure him that the gods have
now with one accord consented to put Troy into his hands, and to
exhort him forthwith to the assembling of his army for the attack.
The ancient commentators were here perplexed by the circumstance
that Zeus puts a falsehood into the mouth of Oneirus. But there
seems no more difficulty in explaining this, than in the narrative
of the book of 1 Kings (chap. xxii. 20), where Jehovah is mentioned
to have put a lying spirit into the mouth of Ahab’s prophets,—the
real awkwardness is, that Oneirus and his falsehood produce no
effect. For in the first place, Agamemnôn takes a step very different
from that which his dream recommends,—and in the next place, when
the Grecian army is at length armed and goes forth to battle,
it does not experience defeat, (which would be the case if the
exhortation of Oneirus really proved mischievous,) but carries on
a successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span>
day’s battle, chiefly through the heroism of Diomêdês. Instead of
arming the Greeks forthwith, Agamemnôn convokes first a council
of chiefs, and next an agora of the host. And though himself in a
temper of mind highly elate with the deceitful assurances of Oneirus,
he deliberately assumes the language of despair in addressing the
troops, having previously prepared Nestor and Odysseus for his doing
so,—merely in order to try the courage of the men, and with formal
instructions, given to these two other chiefs, that they are to speak
in opposition to him. Now this intervention of Zeus and Oneirus,
eminently unsatisfactory when coupled with the incidents which now
follow it, and making Zeus appear, but only appear, to realize his
promise of honoring Achilles as well as of hurting the Greeks,—forms
exactly the point of junction between the Achillêis and the Iliad.<a
id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The freak which Agamemnôn plays off upon the temper of his army,
though in itself childish, serves a sufficient purpose, not only
because it provides a special matter of interest to be submitted to
the Greeks, but also because it calls forth the splendid description,
so teeming with vivacious detail, of the sudden breaking up of the
assembly after Agamemnôn’s harangue, and of the decisive interference
of Odysseus to bring the men back, as well as to put down Thersitês.
This picture of the Greeks in agora, bringing out the two chief
speaking and counselling heroes, was so important a part of the
general Trojan war, that the poet has permitted himself to introduce
it by assuming an inexplicable folly on the part of Agamemnôn; just
as he has ushered in another fine scene in the third book,—the
Teichoskopy, or conversation, between Priam and Helen on the walls
of Troy,—by admitting the supposition that the old king, in the
tenth year of the war, did not know the persons of Agamemnôn and
the other Grecian chiefs. This may serve as an explanation of the
delusion practised by Agamemnôn towards his assembled host; but it
does not at all explain the tame and empty intervention of Oneirus.<a
id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p. 186]</span></p> <p>If
the initial incident of the second book, whereby we pass out of the
Achillêis into the Iliad, is awkward, so also the final incident of
the seventh book, immediately before we come back into the Achillêis,
is not less unsatisfactory,—I mean, the construction of the wall and
ditch round the Greek camp. As the poem now stands, no plausible
reason is assigned why this should be done. Nestor proposes it
without any constraining necessity: for the Greeks are in a career of
victory, and the Trojans are making offers of compromise which imply
conscious weakness,—while Diomêdês is so confident of the approaching
ruin of Troy, that he dissuades his comrades from receiving even
Helen herself, if the surrender should be tendered. “Many Greeks have
been slain,” it is true,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294"
class="fnanchor">[294]</a> as Nestor observes; but an equal or
greater number of Trojans have been slain, and all the Grecian heroes
are yet in full force: the absence of Achilles is not even adverted
to.</p>

<p>Now this account of the building of the fortification seems
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p. 187]</span> be an
after-thought, arising out of the enlargement of the poem beyond
its original scheme. The original Achillêis, passing at once from
the first to the eighth,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295"
class="fnanchor">[295]</a> and from thence to the eleventh book,
might well assume the fortification,—and talk of it as a thing
existing, without adducing any special reason why it was erected.
The hearer would naturally comprehend and follow the existence of
a ditch and wall round the ships, as a matter of course, provided
there was nothing in the previous narrative to make him believe that
the Greeks had originally been without these bulwarks. And since the
Achillêis, immediately after the promise of Zeus to Thetis, at the
close of the first book, went on to describe the fulfilment of that
promise and the ensuing disasters of the Greeks, there was nothing
to surprise any one in hearing that their camp was fortified. But
the case was altered when the first and the eighth books were parted
asunder, in order to make room for descriptions of temporary success
and glory on the part of the besieging army. The brilliant scenes
sketched in the books, from the second to the seventh, mention no
fortification, and even imply its nonexistence; yet, since notice
of it occurs amidst the first description of Grecian disasters in
the eighth book, the hearer, who had the earlier books present to
his memory, might be surprised to find a fortification mentioned
immediately afterwards, unless the construction of it were specially
announced to have intervened. But it will at once appear, that
there was some difficulty in finding a good reason why the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span> Greeks should begin to
fortify at this juncture, and that the poet who discovered the gap
might not be enabled to fill it up with success. As the Greeks have
got on, up to this moment, without the wall, and as we have heard
nothing but tales of their success, why should they now think farther
laborious precautions for security necessary? We will not ask, why
the Trojans should stand quietly by and permit a wall to be built,
since the truce was concluded expressly for burying the dead.<a
id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span>The
tenth book, or Doloneia, was considered by some of the
ancient scholiasts,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297"
class="fnanchor">[297]</a> and has been confidently set forth by the
modern Wolfian critics, as originally a separate poem, inserted by
Peisistratus into the Iliad. How it can ever have been a separate
poem, I do not understand. It is framed with great specialty for the
antecedent circumstances under which it occurs, and would suit for
no other place; though capable of being separately recited, inasmuch
as it has a definite beginning and end, like the story of Nisus and
Euryalus in the Æneid. But while distinctly presupposing and resting
upon the incidents in the eighth book, and in line 88 of the ninth,
(probably, the appointment of sentinels on the part of the Greeks,
as well of the Trojans, formed the close of the battle described in
the eighth book,) it has not the slightest bearing upon the events of
the eleventh or the following books: it goes to make up the general
picture of the Trojan war, but lies quite apart from the Achillêis.
And this is one mark of a portion subsequently inserted,—that, though
fitted on to the parts which precede, it has no influence on those
which follow.</p>

<p>If the proceedings of the combatants on the plain of Troy, between
the first and the eighth book, have no reference either to Achilles,
or to an Achillêis, we find Zeus in Olympus still more completely
putting that hero out of the question, at the beginning of the fourth
book. He is in this last-mentioned passage the Zeus of the Iliad,
not of the Achillêis. Forgetful of his promise to Thetis, in the
first book, he discusses nothing but the question of continuance or
termination of the war, and manifests anxiety only for the salvation
of Troy, in opposition to the miso-Trojan goddesses, who prevent him
from giving effect to the victory of Menelaus over Paris, and the
stipulated restitution of Helen,—in which case, of course, the wrong
offered to Achilles would remain unexpiated. An attentive comparison
will render it evident that the poet who composed the discussion
among the gods, at the beginning of the fourth book, has not been
careful to put himself in harmony either with the Zeus of the first
book, or with the Zeus of the eighth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span>So soon as we
enter upon the eleventh book, the march of the poem becomes quite
different. We are then in a series of events, each paving the way
for that which follows, and all conducing to the result promised
in the first book,—the reappearance of Achilles, as the only means
of saving the Greeks from ruin,—preceded by ample atonement,<a
id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and
followed by the maximum both of glory and revenge. The intermediate
career of Patroclus introduces new elements, which, however, are
admirably woven into the scheme of the poem, as disclosed in the
first book. I shall not deny that there are perplexities in the
detail of events, as described in the battles at the Grecian wall,
and before the ships, from the eleventh to the sixteenth books,
but they appear only cases of partial confusion, such as may be
reasonably ascribed to imperfections of text: the main sequence
remains coherent and intelligible. We find no considerable events
which could be left out without breaking the thread, nor any
incongruity between one considerable event and another. There is
nothing between the eleventh and twenty-second books, which is at all
comparable to the incongruity between the Zeus of the fourth book and
the Zeus of the first and eighth. It may, perhaps, be true, that the
shield of Achilles is a superadded amplification of that which was
originally announced in general terms,—because the poet, from the
eleventh to the twenty-second books, has observed such good economy
of his materials, that he is hardly likely to have introduced one
particular description of such disproportionate length, and having so
little connection with the series of events. But I see no reason for
believing that it is an addition materially later than the rest of
the poem.</p>

<p>It must be confessed, that the supposition here advanced,
in reference to the structure of the Iliad, is not altogether
free from difficulties, because the parts constituting the
original Achillêis<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299"
class="fnanchor">[299]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p.
191]</span> have been more or less altered or interpolated, to suit
the additions made to it, particularly in the eighth book. But it
presents fewer difficulties than any other supposition, and it is the
only means, so far as I know, of explaining the difference between
one part of the Iliad and another; both the continuity of structure,
and the conformity to the opening promise, which are manifest when
we read the books in the order i. viii. xi. to xxii, as contrasted
with the absence of these two qualities in books ii. to vii. ix.
and x. An entire organization, preconceived from the beginning,
would not be likely to produce any such disparity, nor is any such
visible in the Odyssey;<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300"
class="fnanchor">[300]</a> still less would the result<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span> be explained by
supposing integers originally separate, and brought together
without any designed organization. And it is<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span> between these three suppositions that
our choice has to be made. A scheme, and a large scheme too, must
unquestionably be admitted as the basis of any sufficient hypothesis.
But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span> Achillêis
would have been a long poem, half the length of the present Iliad,
and probably not less compact in its structure than the Odyssey.
Moreover, being parted off only by an imaginary line from the
boundless range of the Trojan war, it would admit of enlargement
more easily, and with greater relish to hearers, than the adventures
of one single hero; while the expansion would naturally take place
by adding new Grecian victory,—since the original poem arrived at
the exaltation of Achilles only through a painful series of Grecian
disasters. That the poem under these circumstances should have
received additions, is no very violent hypothesis: in fact, when we
recollect that the integrity both of the Achillêis and of the Odyssey
was neither guarded by printing nor writing, we shall perhaps think
it less wonderful that the former was enlarged,<a id="FNanchor_301"
href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> than that the latter
was not. Any relaxation of the laws of epical unity is a small price
to pay for that splendid poetry, of which we find so much between the
first and the eighth books of our Iliad.</p>

<p>The question respecting unity of authorship is different, and more
difficult to determine, than that respecting consistency of parts,
and sequence in the narrative. A poem conceived on a comparatively
narrow scale may be enlarged afterwards by its original author, with
greater or less coherence and success: the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span> Faust of Goethe affords an example
even in our own generation. On the other hand, a systematic poem may
well have been conceived and executed by prearranged concert between
several poets; among whom probably one will be the governing mind,
though the rest may be effective, and perhaps equally effective, in
respect to execution of the parts. And the age of the early Grecian
epic was favorable to such fraternization of poets, of which the Gens
called Homerids probably exhibited many specimens. In the recital
or singing of a long unwritten poem, many bards must have conspired
together, and in the earliest times the composer and the singer were
one and the same person.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302"
class="fnanchor">[302]</a> Now the individuals comprised in the
Homerid Gens, though doubtless very different among themselves in
respect of mental capacity, were yet homogeneous in respect of
training, means of observation and instruction, social experience,
religious feelings and theories, etc., to a degree much greater
than individuals in modern times. Fallible as our inferences are
on this point, where we have only internal evidence to guide us,
without any contemporary points of comparison, or any species of
collateral information respecting the age, the society, the poets,
the hearers, or the language,—we must nevertheless, in the present
case, take coherence of structure, together with consistency in the
tone of thought, feeling, language, customs, etc., as presumptions
of one author; and the contrary as presumptions of severalty;
allowing, as well as we can, for that inequality of excellence
which the same author may at different times present.</p> <p><span
class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span></p> <p>Now, the case
made out against single-headed authorship of the Odyssey, appears
to me very weak; and those who dispute it, are guided more by their
<i>à priori</i> rejection of ancient epical unity, than by any positive
evidence which the poem itself affords. It is otherwise with regard
to the Iliad. Whatever presumptions a disjointed structure, several
apparent inconsistencies of parts, and large excrescence of actual
matter beyond the opening promise, can sanction,—may reasonably be
indulged against the supposition that this poem all proceeds from a
single author. There is a difference of opinion on the subject among
the best critics, which is, probably, not destined to be adjusted,
since so much depends partly upon critical feeling, partly upon the
general reasonings, in respect to ancient epical unity, with which
a man sits down to the study. For the champions of unity, such as
Mr. Payne Knight, are very ready to strike out numerous and often
considerable passages as interpolations, thus meeting the objections
raised against unity of authorship, on the ground of special
inconsistencies. Hermann and Boeckh, though not going the length of
Lachmann in maintaining the original theory of Wolf, agree with the
latter in recognizing diversity of authors in the poem, to an extent
overpassing the limit of what can fairly be called interpolation.
Payne Knight and Nitzsch are equally persuaded of the contrary. Here,
then, is a decided contradiction among critics, all of whom have
minutely studied the poems since the Wolfian question was raised. And
it is such critics alone who can be said to constitute authority;
for the cursory reader, who dwells upon the parts simply long enough
to relish their poetical beauty, is struck only by that general
sameness of coloring which Wolf himself admits to pervade the poem.<a
id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Having already intimated that, in my judgment, no theory of the
structure of the poem is admissible which does not admit an original
and preconcerted Achillêis,—a stream which begins at the first book
and ends with the death of Hector, in the twenty-second, although
the higher parts of it now remain only in the condition of two
detached lakes, the first book and the eighth,—I reason upon the
same basis with respect to the authorship.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span> Assuming continuity of structure as a
presumptive proof, the whole of this Achillêis must be treated as
composed by one author. Wolf, indeed, affirmed, that he never read
the poem continuously through without being painfully impressed
with the inferiority<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304"
class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and altered style of the last six
books,—and Lachmann carries this feeling farther back, so as to
commence with the seventeenth book. If I could enter fully into this
sentiment, I should then be compelled, not to deny the existence
of a preconceived scheme, but to imagine that the books from the
eighteenth to the twenty-second, though forming part of that scheme,
or Achillêis, had yet been executed by another and an inferior
poet. But it is to be remarked, first, that inferiority of poetical
merit, to a certain extent, is quite reconcilable with unity of
authorship; and, secondly, that the very circumstances upon which
Wolf’s unfavorable judgment is built, seem to arise out of increased
difficulty in the poet’s task, when he came to the crowning cantos of
his designed Achillêis. For that which chiefly distinguishes these
books, is, the direct, incessant, and manual intervention of the gods
and goddesses, formerly permitted by Zeus,—and the repetition of
vast and fantastic conceptions to which such superhuman agency gives
occasion; not omitting the battle of Achilles against Skamander and
Simois, and the burning up of these rivers by Hêphæstus. Now, looking
at this vein of ideas with the eyes of a modern reader, or even with
those of a Grecian critic of the literary ages, it is certain that
the effect is unpleasing: the gods, sublime elements of poetry when
kept in due proportion, are here somewhat vulgarized. But though the
poet here has not succeeded, and probably success was impossible, in
the task which he has prescribed to himself,—yet the mere fact of his
undertaking it, and the manifest distinction between his employment
of divine agency in these latter cantos as compared with the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span> preceding, seems
explicable only on the supposition that they <i>are</i> the latter cantos,
and come in designed sequence, as the continuance of a previous
plan. The poet wishes to surround the coming forth of Achilles
with the maximum of glorious and terrific circumstance; no Trojan
enemy can for a moment hold out against him:<a id="FNanchor_305"
href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> the gods must descend
to the plain of Troy and fight in person, while Zeus, who at the
beginning of the eighth book, had forbidden them to take part,
expressly encourages them to do so at the beginning of the twentieth.
If, then, the nineteenth book (which contains the reconciliation
between Achilles and Agamemnôn, a subject naturally somewhat tame)
and the three following books (where we have before us only the gods,
Achilles, and the Trojans, without hope or courage) are inferior in
execution and interest to the seven preceding books (which describe
the long-disputed and often doubtful death-struggle between the
Greeks and Trojans without Achilles), as Wolf and other critics
affirm,—we may explain the difference without supposing a new poet
as composer; for the conditions of the poem had become essentially
more difficult, and the subject more unpromising. The necessity of
keeping Achilles above the level, even of heroic prowess, restricted
the poet’s means of acting upon the sympathy of his hearers.<a
id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p. 199]</span>The last two
books of the Iliad may have formed part of the original Achillêis.
But the probability rather is, that they are additions; for the death
of Hector satisfies the exigencies of a coherent scheme, and we are
not entitled to extend the oldest poem beyond the limit which such
necessity prescribes. It has been argued on one side by Nitzsch and
O. Müller, that the mind could not leave off with satisfaction at the
moment in which Achilles sates his revenge, and while the bodies of
Patroclus and Hector are lying unburied,—also, that the more merciful
temper which he exhibits in the twenty-fourth book, must always have
been an indispensable sequel, in order to create proper sympathy
with his triumph. Other critics, on the contrary, have taken special
grounds of exception against the last book, and have endeavored
to set it aside as different from the other books, both<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span> in tone and language.
To a certain extent, the peculiarities of the last book appear to
me undeniable, though it is plainly a designed continuance, and not
a substantive poem. Some weight also is due to the remark about the
twenty-third book, that Odysseus and Diomêdês, who have been wounded
and disabled during the fight, now reappear in perfect force, and
contend in the games: here is no case of miraculous healing, and the
inconsistency is more likely to have been admitted by a separate
enlarging poet, than by the schemer of the Achillêis.</p>

<p>The splendid books from the second to v. 322 of the seventh,<a
id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
are equal, in most parts, to any portion of the Achillêis, and are
pointedly distinguished from the latter by the broad view which they
exhibit of the general Trojan war, with all its principal personages,
localities, and causes,—yet without advancing the result promised
in the first book, or, indeed, any final purpose whatever. Even the
desperate wound inflicted by Tlepolemus on Sarpêdon, is forgotten,
when the latter hero is called forth in the subsequent Achillêis.<a
id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
The arguments of Lachmann, who dissects these six books into three
or four separate songs,<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309"
class="fnanchor">[309]</a> carry no conviction to my mind; and
I see no reason why we should not consider all of them to be by
the same author, bound together by the common purpose of giving a
great collective picture which may properly be termed an Iliad.
The tenth book, or Doloneia, though adapted specially to the
place in which it stands, agrees with the books between the first
and eighth in belonging only to the general picture of the war,
without helping forward the march of the Achillêis; yet it seems
conceived in a lower vein, in so far as we can trust our modern
ethical sentiment. One is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[p.
201]</span> unwilling to believe that the author of the fifth book,
or Aristeia of Diomêdês, would condescend to employ the hero whom he
there so brightly glorifies,—the victor even over Arês himself,—in
slaughtering newly-arrived Thracian sleepers, without any large
purpose or necessity.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310"
class="fnanchor">[310]</a> The ninth book, of which I have already
spoken at length, belongs to a different vein of conception, and
seems to me more likely to have emanated from a separate composer.</p>

<p>While intimating these views respecting the authorship of the
Iliad, as being in my judgment the most probable, I must repeat
that, though the study of the poem carries to my mind a sufficient
conviction respecting its structure, the question between unity and
plurality of authors is essentially less determinable. The poem
consists of a part original, and other parts superadded; yet it is
certainly not impossible that the author of the former may<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p. 202]</span> himself have composed
the latter; and such would be my belief if I regarded plurality of
composers as an inadmissible idea. On this supposition, we must
conclude that the poet, while anxious for the addition of new, and
for the most part, highly interesting matter, has not thought fit to
recast the parts and events in such manner as to impart to the whole
a pervading thread of <i>consensus</i> and organization, such as we see in
the Odyssey.</p>

<p>That the Odyssey is of later date than the Iliad, and by a
different author, seems to be now the opinion of most critics,
especially of Payne Knight<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311"
class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and Nitzsch; though O. Müller leans to
a contrary conclusion, at the same time adding that he thinks the
arguments either way not very decisive. There are considerable
differences of statement in the two poems in regard to some of the
gods: Iris is messenger of the gods in the Iliad, and Hermês in the
Odyssey: Æolus, the dispenser of the winds in the Odyssey, is not
noticed in the twenty-third book of the Iliad, but, on the contrary,
Iris invites the winds, as independent gods, to come and kindle the
funeral pile of Patroclus; and, unless we are to expunge the song of
Demodokus in the eighth book of the Odyssey as spurious, Aphroditê
there appears as the wife of Hêphæstus,—a relationship not known to
the Iliad. There are also some other points of difference enumerated
by Mr. Knight and others, which tend to justify the presumption that
the author of the Odyssey is not identical either with the author
of the Achillêis or his enlargers, which G. Hermann considers to be
a point unquestionable.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312"
class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Indeed, the difficulty of supposing a long
coherent poem to have been conceived, composed, and retained, without
any aid of writing, appears to many critics even now, insurmountable,
though the evidences on the other side, are, in my view, sufficient
to outweigh any negative presumption thus suggested. But it is
improbable that the same person should have powers of memorial
combination sufficient for composing two such poems, nor is there any
proof to force upon us such a supposition.</p>

<p>Presuming a difference of authorship between the two poems,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span> I feel less convinced
about the supposed juniority of the Odyssey. The discrepancies
in manners and language in the one and the other, are so little
important, that two different persons, in the same age and society,
might well be imagined to exhibit as great or even greater. It is
to be recollected that the subjects of the two are heterogeneous,
so as to conduct the poet, even were he the same man, into totally
different veins of imagination and illustration. The pictures of
the Odyssey seem to delineate the same heroic life as the Iliad,
though looked at from a distinct point of view: and the circumstances
surrounding the residence of Odysseus, in Ithaka, are just such as we
may suppose him to have left in order to attack Troy. If the scenes
presented to us are for the most part pacific, as contrasted with the
incessant fighting of the Iliad, this is not to be ascribed to any
greater sociality or civilization in the real hearers of the Odyssey,
but to the circumstances of the hero whom the poet undertakes to
adorn: nor can we doubt that the poems of Arktinus and Leschês, of a
later date than the Odyssey, would have given us as much combat and
bloodshed as the Iliad. I am not struck by those proofs of improved
civilization which some critics affirm the Odyssey to present:
Mr. Knight, who is of this opinion, nevertheless admits that the
mutilation of Melanthius, and the hanging up of the female slaves by
Odysseus, in that poem, indicate greater barbarity than any incidents
in the fights before Troy.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313"
class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The more skilful and compact structure of
the Odyssey, has been often considered as a proof of its juniority
in age: and in the case of two poems by the same author, we might
plausibly contend that practice would bring with it improvement in
the combining faculty. But in reference to the poems before us, we
must recollect, first, that in all probability the Iliad (with which
the comparison is taken) is not a primitive but an enlarged poem, and
that the primitive Achillêis might well have been quite as coherent
as the Odyssey; secondly, that between different authors, superiority
in structure is not a proof of subsequent composition, inasmuch as,
on that hypothesis, we should be compelled to admit that the later
poem of Arktinus would be an improvement upon the Odyssey; thirdly,
that, even if it were so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p.
204]</span> we could only infer that the author of the Odyssey
had <i>heard</i> the Achillêis or the Iliad; we could not infer that
he lived one or two generations afterwards.<a id="FNanchor_314"
href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p>On the whole, the balance of probabilities seems in favor of
distinct authorship for the two poems, but the same age,—and that age
a very early one, anterior to the first Olympiad. And they may thus
be used as evidences, and contemporary evidences, for the phenomena
of primitive Greek civilization; while they also show that the power
of constructing long premeditated epics, without the aid of writing,
is to be taken as a characteristic of the earliest known Greek
mind. This was the point controverted by Wolf, which a full review
of the case (in my judgment) decides against him: it is, moreover,
a valuable result for the historian of the Greeks, inasmuch as it
marks out to him the ground from which he is to start in appreciating
their ulterior progress.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315"
class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p> <p><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span></p> <p>Whatever there may be of truth
in the different conjectures of critics respecting the authorship and
structure of these unrivalled poems, we are not to imagine that it is
the perfection of their epical symmetry which has given them their
indissoluble hold upon the human mind, as well modern as ancient.
There is some tendency in critics, from Aristotle downwards,<a
id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> to
invert the order of attributes in respect to the Homeric poems, so
as to dwell most on recondite excellences which escape the unaided
reader, and which are even to a great degree disputable. But it
is given to few minds (as Goethe has remarked<a id="FNanchor_317"
href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>) to appreciate
fully the mechanism of a long poem; and many feel the beauty of the
separate parts, who have no sentiment for the aggregate perfection of
the whole.</p>

<p>Nor were the Homeric poems originally addressed to minds of the
rarer stamp. They are intended for those feelings which the critic
has in common with the unlettered mass, not for that enlarged
range of vision and peculiar standard which he has acquired to
himself. They are of all poems the most absolutely and unreservedly
popular: had they been otherwise, they could<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span> not have lived so long in the mouth
of the rhapsodes, and the ear and memory of the people: and it was
<i>then</i> that their influence was first acquired, never afterwards
to be shaken. Their beauties belong to the parts taken separately,
which revealed themselves spontaneously to the listening crowd at
the festival,—far more than to the whole poem taken together, which
could hardly be appreciated unless the parts were dwelt upon and
suffered to expand in the mind. The most unlettered hearer of those
times could readily seize, while the most instructed reader can still
recognize, the characteristic excellence of Homeric narrative,—its
straightforward, unconscious, unstudied simplicity,—its concrete
forms of speech<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318"
class="fnanchor">[318]</a> and happy alternation of action<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span> with dialogue,—its
vivid pictures of living agents, always clearly and sharply
individualized, whether in the commanding proportions of Achilles and
Odysseus, in the graceful presence of Helen and Penelope, or in the
more humble contrast of Eumæus and Melanthius; and always, moreover,
animated by the frankness with which his heroes give utterance to all
their transient emotions and even all their infirmities,—its constant
reference to those coarser veins of feeling and palpable motives
which belong to all men in common,—its fulness of graphic details,
freshly drawn from the visible and audible world, and though often
homely, never tame, nor trenching upon that limit of satiety to which
the Greek mind was so keenly alive,—lastly, its perpetual junction of
gods and men in the same picture, and familiar appeal to ever-present
divine agency, in harmony with the interpretation of nature at that
time universal.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly easier to feel than to describe the impressive
influence of Homeric narrative: but the time and circumstances under
which that influence was first, and most powerfully felt, preclude
the possibility of explaining it by comprehensive and elaborate
comparisons, such as are implied in Aristotle’s remarks upon the
structure of the poems. The critic who seeks the explanation in the
right place will not depart widely from the point of view of those
rude auditors to whom the poems were originally addressed, or from
the susceptibilities and capacities common to the human bosom in
every stage of progressive culture. And though the refinements and
delicacies of the poems, as well as their general structure, are
a subject of highly interesting criticism,—yet it is not to these
that Homer owes his wide-spread and imperishable popularity. Still
less is it true, as the well-known observations of Horace would lead
us to believe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span>
that Homer is a teacher of ethical wisdom akin and superior to
Chrysippus or Crantor.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319"
class="fnanchor">[319]</a> No didactic purpose is to be found in the
Iliad and Odyssey; a philosopher may doubtless extract, from the
incidents and strongly marked characters which it contains, much
illustrative matter for his exhortations,—but the ethical doctrine
which he applies must emanate from his own reflection. The Homeric
hero manifests virtues or infirmities, fierceness or compassion, with
the same straightforward and simple-minded vivacity, unconscious
of any ideal standard by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[p.
209]</span> which his conduct is to be tried;<a id="FNanchor_320"
href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> nor can we trace in
the poet any ulterior function beyond that of the inspired organ of
the Muse, and the nameless, but eloquent, herald of lost adventures
out of the darkness of the past.</p>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">Greece</span> Proper lies between
the 36th and 40th parallels of north latitude, and between the 21st
and 26th degrees of east longitude. Its greatest length, from Mount
Olympus to Cape Tænarus, may be stated at 250 English miles; its
greatest breadth, from the western coast of Akarnania to Marathon
in Attica, at 180 miles; and the distance eastward from Ambrakia
across Pindus to the Magnesian mountain Homolê and the mouth of the
Peneius is about 120 miles. Altogether, its area is somewhat less
than that of Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321"
class="fnanchor">[321]</a> In regard, however, to all attempts at
determining the exact limits of Greece proper, we may remark, first,
that these limits seem not to have been very precisely defined even
among the Greeks themselves; and next, that so large a proportion
of the Hellens were distributed among islands and colonies, and so
much of their influence upon the world in general produced through
their colonies, as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[p.
212]</span> render the extent of their original domicile a matter of
comparatively little moment to verify.</p>

<p>The chain called Olympus and the Cambunian mountains, ranging
from east and west, and commencing with the Ægean sea or the
gulf of Therma, near the 40th degree of north latitude, is
prolonged under the name of Mount Lingon, until it touches the
Adriatic at the Akrokeraunian promontory. The country south of
this chain comprehended all that in ancient times was regarded
as Greece, or Hellas proper, but it also comprehended something
more. Hellas proper,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322"
class="fnanchor">[322]</a> (or continuous Hellas, to use the language
of Skylax and Dikæarchus) was understood to begin with the town
and gulf of Ambrakia: from thence, northward to the Akrokeraunian
promontory, lay the land called by the Greeks Epirus,—occupied
by the Chaonians, Molossians, and Thesprotians, who were termed
Epirots, and were not esteemed to belong to the Hellenic aggregate.
This at least was the general understanding, though Ætolians and
Akarnanians, in their more distant sections, seem to have been not
less widely removed from the full type of Hellenism than the Epirots
were; while Herodotus is inclined to treat even Molossians and
Thesprotians as Hellens.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323"
class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>At a point about midway between the Ægean and Ionian seas,
Olympus and Lingon are traversed nearly at right angles by the
still longer and vaster chain called Pindus, which stretches in
a line rather west of north from the northern side of the range
of Olympus: the system to which these mountains belong seems to
begin with the lofty masses of greenstone comprised under the name
of Mount Scardus, or Scordus, (Schardagh,)<a id="FNanchor_324"
href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> which is divided
only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[p. 213]</span> by the
narrow cleft, containing the river Drin, from the limestone of the
Albanian Alps. From the southern face of Olympus, Pindus strikes off
nearly southward, forming the boundary between Thessaly and Epirus,
and sending forth about the 39th degree of latitude the lateral
chain of Othrys,—which latter takes an easterly course, forming
the southern boundary of Thessaly, and reaching the sea between
Thessaly and the northern coast of Eubœa. Southward of Othrys, the
chain of Pindus, under the name of Tymphrêstus, still continues,
until another lateral chain, called Œta, projects from it again
towards the east,—forming the lofty coast immediately south of the
Maliac gulf, with the narrow road of Thermopylæ between the two,—and
terminating at the Eubœan strait. At the point of junction with Œta,
the chain of Pindus forks into two branches; one striking to the
westward of south, and reaching across Ætolia, under the names of
Arakynthus, Kurius, Korax, and Taphiassus, to the promontory called
Antirrhion, situated on the northern side of the narrow entrance of
the Corinthian gulf, over against the corresponding promontory of
Rhion in Peloponnesus; the other tending south-east, and forming
Parnassus, Helicon, and Kithærôn; indeed, Ægaleus and Hymettus, even
down to the southernmost cape of Attica, Sunium, may be treated as a
continuance of this chain. From the eastern extremity of Œta, also,
a range of hills, inferior in height to the preceding, takes its
departure in a south-easterly direction, under the various names
of Knêmis, Ptôon, and Teumêssus. It is joined with Kithærôn by the
lateral communication, ranging from west to east, called Parnês;
while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p. 214]</span> the
celebrated Pentelikus, abundant in marble quarries, constitutes its
connecting link, to the south of Parnês with the chain from Kithærôn
to Sunium.</p>

<p>From the promontory of Antirrhion, the line of mountains crosses
into Peloponnesus, and stretches in a southerly direction down to
the extremity of the peninsula called Tænarus, now Cape Matapan.
Forming the boundary between Elis with Messenia on one side, and
Arcadia with Laconia on the other, it bears the successive names of
Olenus, Panachaikus, Pholoê, Erymanthus, Lykæus, Parrhasius, and
Taygetus. Another series of mountains strikes off from Kithærôn
towards the south-west, constituting, under the names of Geraneia and
Oneia, the rugged and lofty Isthmus of Corinth, and then spreading
itself into Peloponnesus. On entering that peninsula, one of its
branches tends westward along the north of Arkadia, comprising the
Akrokorinthus, or citadel of Corinth, the high peak of Kyllênê, the
mountains of Aroanii and Lampeia, and ultimately joining Erymanthus
and Pholoê,—while the other branch strikes southward towards the
south-eastern cape of Peloponnesus, the formidable Cape Malea, or St.
Angelo,—and exhibits itself under the successive names of Apesas,
Artemisium, Parthenium, Parnôn, Thornax, and Zarêx.</p>

<p>From the eastern extremity of Olympus, in a direction rather
to the eastward of south, stretches the range of mountains first
called Ossa, and afterwards Pelion, down to the south-eastern corner
of Thessaly. The long, lofty, and naked back-bone of the island
of Eubœa, may be viewed as a continuance both of this chain and
of the chain of Othrys: the line is farther prolonged by a series
of islands in the Archipelago, Andros, Tênos, Mykonos, and Naxos,
belonging to the group called the Cyclades, or islands encircling
the sacred centre of Delos. Of these Cyclades, others are in like
manner a continuance of the chain which reaches to Cape Sunium,—Keôs,
Kythnos, Seriphos, and Siphnos join on to Attica, as Andros does to
Eubœa. And we might even consider the great island of Krete as a
prolongation of the system of mountains which breasts the winds and
waves at Cape Malea, the island of Kythêra forming the intermediate
link between them. Skiathus, Skopelus, and Skyrus, to the north-east
of Eubœa, also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[p. 215]</span>
mark themselves out as outlying peaks of the range comprehending
Pelion and Eubœa.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325"
class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>By this brief sketch, which the reader will naturally compare
with one of the recent maps of the country, it will be seen that
Greece proper is among the most mountainous territories in Europe.
For although it is convenient, in giving a systematic view of the
face of the country, to group the multiplicity of mountains into
certain chains, or ranges, founded upon approximative uniformity of
direction; yet, in point of fact, there are so many ramifications and
dispersed peaks,—so vast a number of hills and crags of different
magnitude and elevation,—that a comparatively small proportion of the
surface is left for level ground. Not only few continuous plains,
but even few continuous valleys, exist throughout all Greece proper.
The largest spaces of level ground are seen in Thessaly, in Ætolia,
in the western portion of Peloponnesus, and in Bœotia; but irregular
mountains, valleys frequent but isolated, land-locked basins and
declivities, which often occur, but seldom last long, form the
character of the country.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326"
class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>The islands of the Cyclades, Eubœa, Attica, and Laconia, consist
for the most part of micaceous schist, combined with and often
covered by crystalline granular limestone.<a id="FNanchor_327"
href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> The centre<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p. 216]</span> and west of
Peloponnesus, as well as the country north of the Corinthian
gulf from the gulf of Ambrakia to the strait of Eubœa, present a
calcareous formation, varying in different localities as to color,
consistency, and hardness, but, generally, belonging or approximating
to the chalk: it is often very compact, but is distinguished in a
marked manner from the crystalline limestone above mentioned. The two
loftiest summits in Greece<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328"
class="fnanchor">[328]</a> (both, however, lower than Olympus,
estimated at nine thousand seven hundred feet) exhibit this
formation,—Parnassus, which attains eight thousand feet, and the
point of St. Elias in Taygetus, which is not less than seven thousand
eight hundred feet. Clay-slate, and conglomerates of sand, lime,
and clay, are found in many parts: a close and firm conglomerate of
lime composes the Isthmus of Corinth: loose deposits of pebbles,
and calcareous breccia, occupy also some portions of the territory.
But the most important and essential elements of the Grecian soil,
consist of the diluvial and alluvial formations, with which the
troughs and basins are filled up, resulting from the decomposition
of the older adjoining rocks. In these reside the productive powers
of the country, and upon these the grain and vegetables for the
subsistence of the people depend. The mountain regions are to a
great degree barren, destitute at present of wood or any useful
vegetation, though there is reason to believe that they were better
wooded in antiquity: in many parts, however, and especially in Ætolia
and Akarnania, they afford plenty of timber, and in all parts,
pasture for the cattle during summer, at a time when the plains
are thoroughly burnt up.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329"
class="fnanchor">[329]</a> For other articles of food,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[p. 217]</span> dependence must be had
on the valleys, which are occasionally of singular fertility. The low
ground of Thessaly, the valley of the Kephisus, and the borders of
the lake Kopaïs, in Bœotia, the western portion of Elis, the plains
of Stratus on the confines of Akarnania and Ætolia, and those near
the river Pamisus in Messenia, both are now, and were in ancient
times, remarkable for their abundant produce.</p>

<p>Besides the scarcity of wood for fuel, there is another serious
inconvenience to which the low grounds of Greece are exposed,—the
want of a supply of water at once adequate and regular.<a
id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
Abundance of rain falls during the autumnal and winter months, little
or none during the summer; while the naked limestone of the numerous
hills, neither absorbs nor retains moisture, so that the rain runs
off as rapidly as it falls, and springs are rare.<a id="FNanchor_331"
href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Most of the rivers
of Greece are torrents in early spring, and dry before the end
of the summer: the copious combinations of the ancient language,
designated the winter torrent by a special and separate word.<a
id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
The most considerable rivers in the country are, the Peneius, which
carries off all the waters of Thessaly, finding an exit into the
Ægean through the narrow defile which parts Ossa from Olympus,—and
the Achelôus, which flows from Pindus in a south-westerly direction,
separating Ætolia from Akarnania, and emptying itself into the
Ionian sea: the Euênus also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p.
218]</span> takes its rise at a more southerly part of the same
mountain chain, and falls into the same sea more to the eastward.
The rivers more to the southward are unequal and inferior. Kephisus
and Asôpus, in Bœotia, Alpheius, in Elis and Arcadia, Pamisus in
Messenia, maintain each a languid stream throughout the summer;
while the Inachus near Argos, and the Kephisus and Ilissus near
Athens, present a scanty reality which falls short still more of
their great poetical celebrity. Of all those rivers which have been
noticed, the Achelôus is by far the most important. The quantity of
mud which its turbid stream brought down and deposited, occasioned
a sensible increase of the land at its embouchure, within the
observation of Thucydidês.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333"
class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>

<p>But the disposition and properties of the Grecian territory,
though not maintaining permanent rivers, are favorable to the
multiplication of lakes and marshes. There are numerous hollows and
inclosed basins, out of which the water can find no superficial
escape, and where, unless it makes for itself a subterranean passage
through rifts in the mountains, it remains either as a marsh or a
lake according to the time of year. In Thessaly, we find the lakes
Nessônis and Bœbêis; in Ætolia, between the Achelous and Eunêus,
Strabo mentions the lake of Trichônis, besides several other
lakes, which it is difficult to identify individually, though the
quantity of ground covered by lake and marsh is, as a whole, very
considerable. In Bœotia, are situated the lakes Kopaïs, Hylikê,
and Harma; the first of the three formed chiefly by the river
Kephisus, flowing from Parnassus on the north-west, and shaping for
itself a sinuous course through the mountains of Phokis. On the
north-east and east, the lake Kopaïs is bounded by the high land
of Mount Ptôon, which intercepts its communication with the strait
of Eubœa. Through the limestone of this mountain, the water has
either found or forced several subterraneous cavities, by which it
obtains a partial egress on the other side of the rocky hill, and
then flows into the strait. The Katabothra, as they were termed
in antiquity, yet exist, but in an imperfect and half-obstructed
condition. Even in antiquity, however, they never fully sufficed to
carry off the surplus waters of the Kephisus; for the remains are
still found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span> of
an artificial tunnel, pierced through the whole breadth of the rock,
and with perpendicular apertures at proper intervals to let in the
air from above. This tunnel—one of the most interesting remnants
of antiquity, since it must date from the prosperous days of the
old Orchomenus, anterior to its absorption into the Bœotian league,
as well as to the preponderance of Thebes,—is now choked up and
rendered useless. It may, perhaps, have been designedly obstructed
by the hand of an enemy, and the scheme of Alexander the Great, who
commissioned an engineer from Chalkis to reopen it, was defeated,
first, by discontents in Bœotia, and ultimately by his early death.<a
id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>The Katabothra of the lake Kopaïs, are a specimen of the
phenomenon so frequent in Greece,—lakes and rivers finding for
themselves subterranean passages through the cavities in the
limestone rocks, and even pursuing their unseen course for a
considerable distance before they emerge to the light of day. In
Arcadia, especially, several remarkable examples of subterranean
water communication occur; this central region of Peloponnesus
presents a cluster of such completely inclosed valleys, or basins.<a
id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p. 220]</span></p> <p>It
will be seen from these circumstances, that Greece, considering
its limited total extent, offers but little motive, and still
less of convenient means, for internal communication among its
various inhabitants.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336"
class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Each village, or township, occupying
its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[p. 221]</span> plain with
the inclosing mountains,<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337"
class="fnanchor">[337]</a> supplied its own main wants whilst
the transport of commodities by land was sufficiently difficult
to discourage greatly any regular commerce with neighbors. In so
far as the face of the interior country was concerned, it seemed
as if nature had been disposed, from the beginning, to keep the
population of Greece socially and politically disunited,—by
providing so many hedges of separation, and so many boundaries,
generally hard, sometimes impossible, to overleap. One special
motive to intercourse, however, arose out of this very geographical
constitution of the country, and its endless alternation of mountain
and valley. The difference of climate and temperature between the
high and low grounds is very great; the harvest is secured in one
place before it is ripe in another, and the cattle find during the
heat of summer shelter and pasture on the hills, at a time when
the plains are burnt up.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338"
class="fnanchor">[338]</a> The practice of transferring them from
the mountains to the plain according to the change of season,
which subsists still as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[p.
222]</span> did in ancient times, is intimately connected with the
structure of the country, and must from the earliest period have
brought about communication among the otherwise disunited villages.<a
id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Such difficulties, however, in the internal transit by land,
were to a great extent counteracted by the large proportion of
coast, and the accessibility of the country by sea. The prominences
and indentations in the line of Grecian coast, are hardly less
remarkable than the multiplicity of elevations and depressions which
everywhere mark the surface.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340"
class="fnanchor">[340]</a> The shape of Peloponnesus, with its
three southern gulfs, (the Argolic, Laconian, and Messenian,) was
compared by the ancient geographers to the leaf of a plane-tree: the
Pagasæan gulf on the eastern side of Greece, and the Ambrakian gulf
on the western, with their narrow entrances and considerable area,
are equivalent to internal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[p.
223]</span> lakes: Xenophon boasts of the double sea which embraces
so large a proportion of Attica, Ephorus of the triple sea, by
which Bœotia was accessible from west, north, and south,—the
Eubœan strait, opening a long line of country on both sides to
coasting navigation.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341"
class="fnanchor">[341]</a> But the most important of all Grecian
gulfs are the Corinthian and the Saronic, washing the northern and
north-eastern shores of Peloponnesus, and separated by the narrow
barrier of the Isthmus of Corinth. The former, especially, lays open
Ætolia, Phokis, and Bœotia, as well as the whole northern coast of
Peloponnesus, to water approach. Corinth, in ancient times, served as
an entrepôt for the trade between Italy and Asia Minor,—goods being
unshipped at Lechæum, the port on the Corinthian gulf, and carried by
land across to Cenchreæ, the port on the Saronic: indeed, even the
merchant-vessels themselves, when not very large,<a id="FNanchor_342"
href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> were conveyed across
by the same route. It was accounted a prodigious advantage to escape
the necessity of sailing round Cape Malea: and the violent winds
and currents which modern experience attests to prevail around
that formidable promontory, are quite sufficient to justify the
apprehensions of the ancient Greek merchant, with his imperfect
apparatus for navigation.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343"
class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[p. 224]</span>It will
thus appear that there was no part of Greece proper which could
be considered as out of reach of the sea, while most parts of
it were convenient and easy of access: in fact, the Arcadians
were the only large section of the Hellenic name, (we may add
the Doric, Tetrapolis, and the mountaineers along the chain of
Pindus and Tymphrêstus,) who were altogether without a seaport.<a
id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
But Greece proper constituted only a fraction of the entire
Hellenic world, during the historical age: there were the numerous
islands, and still more numerous continental colonies, all located
as independent intruders on distinct points of the coast,<a
id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
in the Euxine, the Ægean, the Mediterranean, and the Adriatic; and
distant from each other by the space which separates Trebizond
from Marseilles. All these various cities were comprised in the
name Hellas, which implied no geographical continuity: all prided
themselves on Hellenic blood, name, religion, and mythical ancestry.
As the only communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p.
225]</span> between them was maritime, so the sea, important, even
if we look to Greece proper exclusively, was the sole channel for
transmitting ideas and improvements, as well as for maintaining
sympathies—social, political, religious, and literary—throughout
these outlying members of the Hellenic aggregate.</p>

<p>The ancient philosophers and legislators were deeply impressed
with the contrast between an inland and a maritime city: in the
former, simplicity and uniformity of life, tenacity of ancient
habits, and dislike of what is new or foreign, great force of
exclusive sympathy, and narrow range both of objects and ideas; in
the latter, variety and novelty of sensations, expansive imagination,
toleration, and occasional preference for extraneous customs, greater
activity of the individual, and corresponding mutability of the
state. This distinction stands prominent in the many comparisons
instituted between the Athens of Periklês and the Athens of the
earlier times down to Solôn. Both Plato and Aristotle dwell upon
it emphatically,—and the former especially, whose genius conceived
the comprehensive scheme of prescribing beforehand and insuring in
practice the whole course of individual thought and feeling in his
imaginary community, treats maritime communication, if pushed beyond
the narrowest limits, as fatal to the success and permanence of any
wise scheme of education. Certain it is, that a great difference of
character existed between those Greeks who mingled much in maritime
affairs, and those who did not. The Arcadian may stand as a type of
the pure Grecian landsman, with his rustic and illiterate habits,<a
id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>—his
diet of sweet chestnuts, barley-cakes, and pork (as contrasted
with the fish which formed the chief seasoning for the bread
of an Athenian,)—his superior courage and endurance,—his
reverence for Lacedaemonian headship as<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span> an old and customary influence,—his
sterility of intellect and imagination, as well as his slackness in
enterprise,—his unchangeable rudeness of relations with the gods,
which led him to scourge and prick Pan, if he came back empty-handed
from the chase; while the inhabitant of Phôkæa or Miletus exemplifies
the Grecian mariner, eager in search of gain,—active, skilful,
and daring at sea, but inferior in stedfast bravery on land,—more
excitable in imagination as well as more mutable in character,—full
of pomp and expense in religious manifestations towards the Ephesian
Artemis or the Apollo of Branchidæ; with a mind more open to the
varieties of Grecian energy and to the refining influences of Grecian
civilization. The Peloponnesians generally, and the Lacedæmonians in
particular, approached to the Arcadian type,—while the Athenians of
the fifth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> stood foremost in the other;
superadding to it, however, a delicacy of taste, and a predominance
of intellectual sympathy and enjoyments, which seem to have been
peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>The configuration of the Grecian territory, so like in many
respects to that of Switzerland, produced two effects of great moment
upon the character and history of the people. In the first place,
it materially strengthened their powers of defence: it shut up the
country against those invasions from the interior, which successively
subjugated all their continental colonies; and it at the same time
rendered each fraction more difficult to be attacked by the rest,
so as to exercise a certain conservative influence in assuring the
tenure of actual possessors: for the pass of Thermopylæ, between
Thessaly and Phokis, that of Kythærôn, between Bœotia and Attica, or
the mountainous range of Oneion and Geraneia along the Isthmus of
Corinth, were positions which an inferior number of brave men could
hold against a much greater force of assailants. But, in the next
place, while it tended to protect each section of Greeks from being
conquered, it also kept them politically disunited, and perpetuated
their separate autonomy. It fostered that powerful principle of
repulsion, which disposed even the smallest township to constitute
itself a political unit apart from the rest, and to resist all
idea of coalescence with others, either amicable or compulsory.
To a modern leader, accustomed to large political aggregations,
and securities for good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p.
227]</span> government through the representative system, it
requires a certain mental effort to transport himself back to a
time when even the smallest town clung so tenaciously to its right
of self-legislation. Nevertheless, such was the general habit and
feeling of the ancient world, throughout Italy, Sicily, Spain,
and Gaul. Among the Hellenes, it stands out more conspicuously,
for several reasons,—first, because they seem to have pushed the
multiplication of autonomous units to an extreme point, seeing that
even islands not larger than Peparêthos and Amorgos had two or three
separate city communities;<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347"
class="fnanchor">[347]</a> secondly, because they produced, for the
first time in the history of mankind, acute systematic thinkers
on matters of government, amongst all of whom the idea of the
autonomous city was accepted as the indispensable basis of political
speculation; thirdly, because this incurable subdivision proved
finally the cause of their ruin, in spite of pronounced intellectual
superiority over their conquerors: and lastly, because incapacity
of political coalescence did not preclude a powerful and extensive
sympathy between the inhabitants of all the separate cities, with
a constant tendency to fraternize for numerous purposes, social,
religious, recreative, intellectual, and æsthetical. For these
reasons, the indefinite multiplication of self-governing towns,
though in truth a phenomenon common to ancient Europe, as contrasted
with the large monarchies of Asia, appears more marked among the
ancient Greeks than elsewhere: and there cannot be any doubt that
they owe it, in a considerable degree, to the multitude of insulating
boundaries which the configuration of their country presented.</p>

<p>Nor is it rash to suppose that the same causes may have tended
to promote that unborrowed intellectual development for which they
stand so conspicuous. General propositions respecting the working
of climate and physical agencies upon character are, indeed,
treacherous; for our knowledge of the globe is now sufficient to
teach us that heat and cold, mountain and plain, sea and land, moist
and dry atmosphere, are all consistent with the greatest diversities
of resident men: moreover, the contrast between the population of
Greece itself, for the seven centuries preceding the Christian era,
and the Greeks of more modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[p.
228]</span> times, is alone enough to inculcate reserve in such
speculations. Nevertheless, we may venture to note certain improving
influences, connected with their geographical position, at a time
when they had no books to study, and no more advanced predecessors
to imitate. We may remark, first, that their position made them
at once mountaineers and mariners, thus supplying them with great
variety of objects, sensations, and adventures; next, that each petty
community, nestled apart amidst its own rocks,<a id="FNanchor_348"
href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> was sufficiently
severed from the rest to possess an individual life and attributes
of its own, yet not so far as to subtract it from the sympathies of
the remainder; so that an observant Greek, commercing with a great
diversity of half countrymen, whose language he understood, and whose
idiosyncrasies he could appreciate, had access to a larger mass of
social and political experience than any other man in so unadvanced
an age could personally obtain. The Phœnician, superior to the Greek
on shipboard, traversed wider distances, and saw a greater number
of strangers, but had not the same means of intimate communion with
a multiplicity of fellows in blood and language. His relations,
confined to purchase and sale, did not comprise that mutuality of
action and reaction which pervaded the crowd at a Grecian festival.
The scene which here presented itself, was a mixture of uniformity
and variety highly stimulating to the observant faculties of a man
of genius,—who at the same time, if he sought to communicate his own
impressions, or to act upon this mingled and diverse audience, was
forced to shake off what was peculiar to his own town or community,
and to put forth matter in harmony with the feelings of all. It is
thus that we may explain, in part, that penetrating apprehension
of human life and character, and that power of touching sympathies
common to all ages and nations, which surprises us so much in the
unlettered authors of the old epic. Such periodical intercommunion of
brethren habitually isolated from each other, was the only means then
open of procuring for the bard a diversified range of experience and
a many-colored audience; and it was to a great degree the result of
geographical causes. Perhaps among other nations such facilitating
causes might have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[p.
229]</span> found, yet without producing any result comparable to
the Iliad and Odyssey. But Homer was, nevertheless, dependent upon
the conditions of his age, and we can at least point out those
peculiarities in early Grecian society, without which Homeric
excellence would never have existed,—the geographical position is
one, the language another.</p>

<p>In mineral and metallic wealth, Greece was not distinguished. Gold
was obtained in considerable abundance in the island of Siphnos,
which, throughout the sixth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, was among
the richest communities of Greece, and possessed a treasure-chamber
at Delphi, distinguished for the richness of its votive offerings.
At that time, gold was so rare in Greece, that the Lacedæmonians
were obliged to send to the Lydian Crœsus, in order to provide
enough of it for the gilding of a statue.<a id="FNanchor_349"
href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> It appears to have
been more abundant in Asia Minor, and the quantity of it in Greece
was much multiplied by the opening of mines in Thrace, Macedonia,
Epirus, and even some parts of Thessaly. In the island of Thasos,
too, some mines were reopened with profitable result, which had been
originally begun, and subsequently abandoned, by Phœnician settlers
of an earlier century. From these same districts, also, was procured
a considerable amount of silver; while, about the beginning of the
fifth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the first effective commencement
seems to have been made of turning to account the rich southern
district of Attica, called Laureion. Copper was obtained in various
parts of Greece, especially in Cyprus and Eubœa,—in which latter
island was also found the earth called Cadmia, employed for the
purification of the ore. Bronze was used among the Greeks for many
purposes in which iron is now employed: and even the arms of the
Homeric heroes (different in this respect from the later historical
Greeks) are composed of copper, tempered in such a way as to impart
to it an astonishing hardness. Iron was found in Eubœa, Bœôtia, and
Melos,—but still more abundantly in the moun<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span>tainous region of the Laconian Taygetus.
There is, however no part of Greece where the remains of ancient
metallurgy appear now so conspicuous, as the island of Seriphos.
The excellence and varieties of marble, from Pentelikus, Hymettus,
Paros, Karystus, etc., and other parts of the country,—so essential
for the purposes of sculpture and architecture,—is well known.<a
id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>Situated under the same parallels of latitude as the coast
of Asia Minor, and the southernmost regions of Italy and Spain,
Greece produced wheat, barley, flax, wine, and oil, in the
earliest times of which we have any knowledge;<a id="FNanchor_351"
href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> though the currants,
Indian corn, silk, and tobacco, which the country now exhibits, are
an addition of more recent times. Theophrastus and other authors
amply attest the observant and industrious agriculture prevalent
among the ancient Greeks, as well as the care with which its
various natural productions, comprehending a great diversity of
plants, herbs, and trees, were turned to account. The cultivation
of the vine and the olive,—the latter indispensable to ancient
life, not merely for the purposes which it serves at present,
but also from the constant habit then prevalent of anointing the
body,—appears to have been particularly elaborate; and the many
different accidents of soil, level, and exposure, which were to be
found, not only in Hellas proper, but also among the scattered Greek
settlements, afforded to observant planters materials for study and
comparison. The barley-cake seems to have been more generally eaten
than the wheaten loaf;<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352"
class="fnanchor">[352]</a> but one or<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span> other of them, together with vegetables
and fish, (sometimes fresh, but more frequently salt,) was the
common food of the population; the Arcadians fed much upon pork,
and the Spartans also consumed animal food; but by the Greeks,
generally, fresh meat seems to have been little eaten, except
at festivals and sacrifices. The Athenians, the most commercial
people in Greece proper, though their light, dry, and comparatively
poor soil produced excellent barley, nevertheless, did not grow
enough corn for their own consumption: they imported considerable
supplies of corn from Sicily, from the coast of the Euxine, and
the Tauric Chersonese, and salt-fish both from the Propontis
and even from Gades:<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353"
class="fnanchor">[353]</a> the distance from whence these supplies
came, when we take into consideration the extent of fine corn-land
in Bœotia and Thessaly, proves how little internal trade existed
between the various regions of Greece proper. The exports of Athens
consisted in her figs and other fruit, olives, oil,—for all of
which she was distinguished,—together with pottery, ornamental
manufactures, and the silver from her mines at Laureion. Salt-fish,
doubtless, found its way more or less throughout all Greece;<a
id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
but the population of other states in Greece lived more
exclusively upon their own produce than the Athenians, with less
of purchase and sale,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355"
class="fnanchor">[355]</a>—a mode of life assisted by the simple
domestic econ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[p. 232]</span>omy
universally prevalent, in which the women not only carded and spun
all the wool, but also wove out of it the clothing and bedding
employed in the family. Weaving was then considered as much a woman’s
business as spinning, and the same feeling and habits still prevail
to the present day in modern Greece, where the loom is constantly
seen in the peasants’ cottages, and always worked by women.<a
id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>The climate of Greece appears to be generally described by modern
travellers in more favorable terms than it was by the ancients,
which is easily explicable from the classical interest, picturesque
beauties, and transparent atmosphere, so vividly appreciate
by an English or a German eye. Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_357"
href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Hippocrates,
and Aristotle, treat the climate of Asia as far more genial and
favorable both to animal and vegetable life, but at the same time
more enervating than that of Greece: the latter, they speak of
chiefly in reference to its changeful character and diversities of
local temperature, which they consider as highly stimulant to the
energies of the inhabitants. There is reason to conclude that ancient
Greece was much more healthy than the same territory is at present,
inasmuch as it was more industriously cultivated, and the towns
both more carefully administered and better supplied with water.
But the differences in respect of healthiness, between one portion
of Greece and another, appear always to have been considerable, and
this, as well as the diversities of climate, affected the local
habits and the character of the particular sections. Not merely
were there great differences between the mountaineers and the
inhabitants of the plains,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358"
class="fnanchor">[358]</a>—between Lokrains, Ætolians, Phokians,
Dorians, Œtæans, and Arcadians, on one hand, and the inhabitants of
Attica, Bœotia, and Elis, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[p.
233]</span> the other,—but each of the various tribes which went
to compose these categories, had its peculiarities; and the
marked contrast between Athenians and Bœotians was supposed to be
represented by the light and heavy atmosphere which they respectively
breathed. Nor was this all: for, even among the Bœotian aggregate,
every town had its own separate attributes, physical as well as
moral and political:<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359"
class="fnanchor">[359]</a> Orôpus, Tanagra, Thespiæ, Thebes,
Anthêdôn, Haliartus, Korôneia, Onchêstus, and Platæa, were known to
Bœotians each by its own characteristic epithet: and Dikæarchus even
notices a marked distinction between the inhabitants of the city of
Athens and those in the country of Attica. Sparta, Argos, Corinth,
and Sikyôn, though all called Doric, had each its own dialect and
peculiarities. All these differences, depending in part upon climate,
site, and other physical considerations, contributed to nourish
antipathies, and to perpetuate that imperfect cohesion, which has
already been noticed as an indelible feature in Hellas.</p>

<p>The Epirotic tribes, neighbors of the Ætolians and Akarnanians,
filled the space between Pindus and the Ionian sea until they
joined to the northward the territory inhabited by the powerful
and barbarous Illyrians. Of these Illyrians, the native Macedonian
tribes appear to have been an outlying section, dwelling northward
of Thessaly and Mount Olympus, eastward of the chain by which
Pindus is continued, and westward of the river Axius. The Epirots
were comprehended under the various denominations of Chaonians,
Molossians, Thesprotians, Kassopæans, Amphilochians, Athamānes, the
Æthīkes, Tymphæi, Orestæ, Paroræi, and Atintānes,<a id="FNanchor_360"
href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>—most of the latter
being small communities dispersed about the mountainous region
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p. 234]</span> Pindus.
There was, however, much confusion in the application of the
comprehensive name <i>Epirot</i>, which was a title given altogether by
the Greeks, and given purely upon geographical, not upon ethnical
considerations. Epirus seems at first to have stood opposed to
Peloponnesus, and to have signified the general region northward of
the gulf of Corinth; and in this primitive sense it comprehended the
Ætolians and Akarnanians, portions of whom spoke a dialect difficult
to understand, and were not less widely removed than the Epirots
from Hellenic habits.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361"
class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The oracle of Dodona forms the point of
ancient union between Greeks and Epirots, which was superseded by
Delphi, as the civilization of Hellas developed itself. Nor is it
less difficult to distinguish Epirots from Macedonians on the one
hand, than from Hellenes on the other; the language, the dress,
and the fashion of wearing the hair being often analogous, while
the boundaries, amidst rude men and untravelled tracts, were very
inaccurately understood.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362"
class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>In describing the limits occupied by the Hellens in 776
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, we cannot yet take account of the
important colonies of Leukas and Ambrakia, established by the
Corinthians subsequently on the western coast of Epirus. The Greeks
of that early time seem to comprise the islands of Kephallenia,
Zakynthus, Ithaka, and Dulichium, but no settlement, either inland or
insular, farther northward.</p>

<p>They include farther, confining ourselves to 776
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the great mass of islands between the
coast of Greece and that of Asia Minor, from Tenedos on the north,
to Rhodes, Krete, and Kythêra southward; and the great islands
of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, and Eubœa, as well as the groups called
the Sporades and the Cyclades. Respecting the four considerable
islands nearer to the coasts of Macedonia and Thrace,—Lemnos,
Imbros, Samothrace, and Thasos,—it may be doubted whether they<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span> were at that time
Hellenized. The Catalogue of the Iliad includes, under Agamemnôn,
contingents from Ægina, Eubœa, Krete, Karpathus, Kasus, Kôs, and
Rhodes: in the oldest epical testimony which we possess, these
islands thus appear inhabited by Greeks; but the others do not
occur in the Catalogue, and are never mentioned in such manner as
to enable us to draw any inference. Eubœa ought, perhaps, rather to
be looked upon as a portion of Grecian mainland (from which it was
only separated by a strait narrow enough to be bridged over) than as
an island. But the last five islands named in the Catalogue are all
either wholly or partially Doric: no Ionic or Æolic island appears in
it: these latter, though it was among them that the poet sung, appear
to be represented by their ancestral heroes, who came from Greece
proper.</p>

<p>The last element to be included, as going to make up the Greece
of 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, is the long string of Doric, Ionic,
and Æolic settlements on the coast of Asia Minor,—occupying a
space bounded on the north by the Troad and the region of Ida,
and extending southward as far as the peninsula of Knidus. Twelve
continental cities, over and above the islands of Lesbos and Tenedos,
are reckoned by Herodotus as ancient Æolic foundations,—Smyrna, Kymê,
Larissa, Neon-Teichos, Têmnos, Killa, Notium, Ægirœssa, Pitana,
Ægæ, Myrina, and Gryneia. Smyrna, having been at first Æolic, was
afterwards acquired through a stratagem by Ionic inhabitants,
and remained permanently Ionic. Phokæa, the northernmost of the
Ionic settlements, bordered upon Æolis: Klazomenæ, Erythræ, Teôs,
Lebedos, Kolophôn, Priênê, Myus, and Milêtus, continued the Ionic
name to the southward. These, together with Samos and Chios, formed
the Panionic federation.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363"
class="fnanchor">[363]</a> To the south of Milêtus, after a
considerable interval, lay the Doric establishments of Myndus,
Halikarnassus, and Knidus: the two latter, together with the island
of Kôs and the three townships in Rhodes, constituted the Doric
Hexapolis, or communion of six cities, concerted primarily with
a view to religious purposes, but producing a secondary effect
analogous to political federation.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the extent of Hellas, as it stood at the com<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p. 236]</span>mencement of the
recorded Olympiads. To draw a picture even for this date, we possess
no authentic materials, and are obliged to ante-date statements which
belong to a later age: and this consideration might alone suffice
to show how uncertified are all delineations of the Greece of 1183
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the supposed epoch of the Trojan war, four
centuries earlier.</p>

    THE HELLENIC PEOPLE GENERALLY, IN THE EARLY
    HISTORICAL TIMES.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">The</span> territory indicated in
the last chapter—south of Mount Olympus, and south of the line which
connects the city of Ambrakia with Mount Pindus,—was occupied during
the historical period by the central stock of the Hellens, or Greeks,
from which their numerous outlying colonies were planted out.</p>

<p>Both metropolitans and colonists styled themselves Hellens, and
were recognized as such by each other; all glorying in the name as
the prominent symbol of fraternity;—all describing non-Hellenic men,
or cities, by a word which involved associations of repugnance.
Our term <i>barbarian</i>, borrowed from this latter word, does not
express the same idea; for the Greeks spoke thus indiscriminately
of the extra-Hellenic world, with all its inhabitants;<a
id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
whatever might be the gentleness of their character, and whatever
might be their degree of civilization. The rulers and people of
Egyptian Thebes, with their ancient and gigantic monuments, the
wealthy Tyrians and Carthaginians, the phil-Hellene Arganthonius
of Tartêssus, and the well-disciplined patricians of Rome (to the
indignation of old Cato,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365"
class="fnanchor">[365]</a>) were all<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span> comprised in it. At first, it
seemed to have expressed more of repugnance than of contempt, and
repugnance especially towards the sound of a foreign language.<a
id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
Afterwards, a feeling of their own superior intelligence (in part
well justified) arose among the Greeks, and their term <i>barbarian</i>
was used so as to imply a low state of the temper and intelligence;
in which sense it was retained by the semi-Hellenized Romans, as
the proper antithesis to their state of civilization. The want of a
suitable word, corresponding to <i>barbarian</i>, as the Greeks originally
used it, is so inconvenient in the description of Grecian phenomena
and sentiments, that I may be obliged occasionally to use the word in
its primitive sense.</p>

<p>The Hellens were all of common blood and parentage,—were all
descendants of the common patriarch Hellen. In treating of the
historical Greeks, we have to accept this as a datum: it represents
the sentiment under the influence of which they moved and acted. It
is placed by Herodotus in the front rank, as the chief of those four
ties which bound together the Hellenic aggregate: 1. Fellowship of
blood; 2. Fellowship of language; 3. Fixed domiciles of gods, and
sacrifices, common to all; 4. Like manners and dispositions.</p>

<p><i>These</i> (say the Athenians, in their reply to the Spartan envoys,
in the very crisis of the Persian invasion) “Athens will never
disgrace herself by betraying.” And Zeus Hellenius was recog<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span>nized as the god
watching over and enforcing the fraternity thus constituted.<a
id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>Hekatæus, Herodotus, and Thucydidês,<a id="FNanchor_368"
href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> all believed that
there had been an ante-Hellenic period, when different languages,
mutually unintelligible, were spoken between Mount Olympus and
Cape Malea. However this may be, during the historical times the
Greek language was universal throughout these limits,—branching
out, however, into a great variety of dialects, which were roughly
classified by later literary men into Ionic, Doric, Æolic, and Attic.
But the classification presents a semblance of regularity, which in
point of fact does not seem to have been realized; each town, each
smaller subdivision of the Hellenic name, having peculiarities of
dialect belonging to itself. Now the lettered men who framed the
quadruple division took notice chiefly, if not exclusively, of the
written dialects,—those which had been ennobled by poets or other
authors; the mere spoken idioms were for the most part neglected.<a
id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
That there was no such thing as one Ionic dialect in the speech
of the people called Ionic Greek, we know from the indisputable
testimony of Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370"
class="fnanchor">[370]</a> who tells us that there were four capital
varieties of speech among the twelve Asiatic towns especially known
as Ionic. Of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p. 239]</span>
course, the varieties would have been much more numerous if he had
given us the impressions of his ear in Eubœa, the Cyclades, Massalia,
Rhegium, and Olbia,—all numbered as Greeks and as Ionians. The Ionic
dialect of the grammarians was an extract from Homer, Hekatæus,
Herodotus, Hippocrates, etc.; to what living speech it made the
nearest approach, amidst those divergences which the historian has
made known to us, we cannot tell. Sapphô and Alkæus in Lesbos,
Myrtis and Korinna in Bœotia, were the great sources of reference
for the Lesbian and Bœotian varieties of the Æolic dialect,—of which
there was a third variety, untouched by the poets, in Thessaly.<a
id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
The analogy between the different manifestations of Doric and
Æolic, as well as that between the Doric generally and the Æolic
generally, contrasted with the Attic, is only to be taken as rough
and approximative.</p>

<p>But all these different dialects are nothing more than dialects,
distinguished as modifications of one and the same language, and
exhibiting evidence of certain laws and principles pervading them
all. They seem capable of being traced back to a certain ideal
mother-language, peculiar in itself and distinguishable from, though
cognate with, the Latin; a substantive member of what has been called
the Indo-European family of languages. This truth has been brought
out, in recent times, by the comparative examination applied to the
Sanscrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, German, and Lithuanian languages,
as well as by the more accurate analysis of the Greek language
itself to which such studies have given rise, in a manner much more
clear than could have been imagined by the ancients themselves.<a
id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
It is needless to dwell upon the importance of this uniformity of
language in holding together the race, and in rendering the genius
of its most favored members available to the civilization of all.
Except in the rarest cases, the divergences of dialect were not such
as to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[p. 240]</span>
every Greek from understanding, and being understood by, every
other Greek,—a fact remarkable, when we consider how many of their
outlying colonists, not having taken out women in their emigration,
intermarried with non-Hellenic wives. And the perfection and
popularity of their early epic poems, was here of inestimable value
for the diffusion of a common type of language, and for thus keeping
together the sympathies of the Hellenic world.<a id="FNanchor_373"
href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> The Homeric dialect
became the standard followed by all Greek poets for the hexameter,
as may be seen particularly from the example of Hesiod,—who adheres
to it in the main, though his father was a native of the Æolic Kymê,
and he himself resident at Askra, in the Æolic Bœotia,—and the
early iambic and elegiac compositions are framed on the same model.
Intellectual Greeks in all cities, even the most distant outcasts
from the central hearth, became early accustomed to one type of
literary speech, and possessors of a common stock of legends, maxims,
and metaphors.</p>

<p>That community of religious sentiments, localities, and
sacrifices, which Herodotus names as the third bond of union among
the Greeks, was a phenomenon, not (like the race and the language)
interwoven with their primitive constitution, but of gradual
growth. In the time of Herodotus, and even a century earlier, it
was at its full maturity: but there had been a period when no
religious meetings common to the whole Hellenic body existed. What
are called the Olympic, Pythian, Nemean, and Isthmian games, (the
four most conspicuous amidst many others analogous,) were, in
reality, great religious festivals,—for the gods then gave their
special sanction, name, and presence, to recreative meetings,—the
closest association then prevailed between the feelings of common
worship and the sympathy in common amusement.<a id="FNanchor_374"
href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_241">[p. 241]</span> Though this association is now no
longer recognized, it is, nevertheless, essential that we should
keep it fully before us, if we desire to understand the life and
proceedings of the Greeks. To Herodotus and his contemporaries,
these great festivals, then frequented by crowds from every part of
Greece, were of overwhelming importance and interest; yet they had
once been purely local, attracting no visitors except from a very
narrow neighborhood. In the Homeric poems, much is said about the
common gods, and about special places consecrated to and occupied
by several of them: the chiefs celebrate funeral games in honor of
a deceased father, which are visited by competitors from different
parts of Greece, but nothing appears to manifest public or town
festivals open to Grecian visitors generally.<a id="FNanchor_375"
href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> And, though the rocky
Pytho, with its temple, stands out in the Iliad as a place both
venerated and rich,—the Pythian games, under the superintendence
of the Amphiktyons, with continuous enrolment of victors, and a
Pan-Hellenic reputation, do not begin until after the Sacred War, in
the 48th Olympiad, or 586 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a id="FNanchor_376"
href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>The Olympic games, more conspicuous than the Pythian, as well as
considerably older, are also remarkable on another ground,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span> inasmuch as they
supplied historical computers with the oldest backward record of
continuous time. It was in the year 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
that the Eleians inscribed the name of their countryman, Korœbus,
as victor in the competition of runners, and that they began the
practice of inscribing in like manner, in each Olympic, or fifth
recurring year, the name of the runner who won the prize. Even for
a long time after this, however, the Olympic games seem to have
remained a local festival; the prize being uniformly carried off, at
the first twelve Olympiads, by some competitor either of Elis or its
immediate neighborhood. The Nemean and Isthmian games did not become
notorious or frequented until later even than the Pythian. Solôn,<a
id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> in
his legislation, proclaimed the large reward of five hundred drachms
for every Athenian who gained an Olympic prize, and the lower sum of
one hundred drachms for an Isthmiac prize. He counts the former, as
Pan-Hellenic rank and renown, an ornament even to the city of which
the victor was a member,—the latter, as partial, and confined to the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>Of the beginnings of these great solemnities, we cannot presume
to speak, except in mythical language: we know them only<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span> in their comparative
maturity. But the habit of common sacrifice, on a small scale, and
between near neighbors, is a part of the earliest habits of Greece.
The sentiment of fraternity, between two tribes or villages, first
manifested itself by sending a sacred legation, or Theôria,<a
id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
to offer sacrifice at each other’s festivals, and to partake in the
recreations which followed; thus establishing a truce with solemn
guarantee, and bringing themselves into direct connection each with
the god of the other under his appropriate local surname. The pacific
communion so fostered, and the increased assurance of intercourse,
as Greece gradually emerged from the turbulence and pugnacity of
the heroic age, operated especially in extending the range of
this ancient habit: the village festivals became town festivals,
largely frequented by the citizens of other towns, and sometimes
with special invitations sent round to attract Theôrs from every
Hellenic community,—and thus these once humble assemblages gradually
swelled into the pomp and immense confluence of the Olympic and
Pythian games. The city administering such holy ceremonies enjoyed
inviolability of territory during the month of their occurrence,
being itself under obligation at that time to refrain from all
aggression, as well as to notify by heralds<a id="FNanchor_379"
href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> the commencement
of the truce to all other cities not in avowed hostility with it.
Elis imposed heavy fines upon other towns—even on the powerful
Lacedæmon—for violation of the Olympic truce, on pain of exclusion
from the festival in case of non-payment.</p>

<p>Sometimes this tendency to religious fraternity took a form
called an Amphiktyony, different from the common festival. A<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span> certain number of
towns entered into an exclusive religious partnership, for the
celebration of sacrifices periodically to the god of a particular
temple, which was supposed to be the common property, and under
the common protection of all, though one of the number was often
named as permanent administrator; while all other Greeks were
excluded. That there were many religious partnerships of this sort,
which have never acquired a place in history, among the early
Grecian villages, we may, perhaps, gather from the etymology of
the word, (Amphiktyons<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380"
class="fnanchor">[380]</a> designates residents around, or neighbors,
considered in the point of view of fellow-religionists,) as well as
from the indications preserved to us in reference to various parts
of the country. Thus there was an Amphiktyony<a id="FNanchor_381"
href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> of seven cities
at the holy island of Kalauria, close to the harbor of Trœzên.
Hermionê, Epidaurus, Ægina, Athens, Prasiæ, Nauplia, and Orchomenus,
jointly maintained the temple and sanctuary of Poseidôn in that
island, (with which it would seem that the city of Trœzên, though
close at hand, had no connection,) meeting there at stated periods,
to offer formal sacrifices. These seven cities, indeed, were not
immediate neighbors, but the speciality and exclusiveness of
their interest in the temple is seen from the fact, that when the
Argeians took Nauplia, they adopted and fulfilled these religious
obligations on behalf of the prior inhabitants: so, also, did the
Lacedæmonians, when they had captured Prasiæ. Again, in Triphylia,<a
id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>
situated between the Pisatid and Messenia, in the western part of
Peloponnesus, there was a similar religious meeting and partnership
of the Triphylians on Cape Samikon, at the temple of the Samian
Poseidôn. Here, the inhabitants of Makiston were intrusted with the
details of superintendence, as well as with the duty of notifying
beforehand the exact time of meeting, (a precaution essential amidst
the diversities and irregularities of the Greek calendar,) and
also of proclaiming what was called the Samian truce,—a temporary
abstinence from hostilities, which bound all Triphylians during the
holy period. This latter custom discloses the salutary influence of
such institutions in presenting to men’s minds a common object<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span> of reverence, common
duties, and common enjoyments; thus generating sympathies and
feelings of mutual obligation amidst petty communities not less
fierce than suspicious.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383"
class="fnanchor">[383]</a> So, too, the twelve chief Ionic cities
in and near Asia Minor, had their Pan-Ionic Amphiktyony peculiar to
themselves: the six Doric cities, in and near the southern corner
of that peninsula, combined for the like purpose at the temple of
the Triopian Apollo; and the feeling of special partnership is here
particularly illustrated by the fact, that Halikarnassus, one of the
six, was formally extruded by the remaining five, in consequence of
a violation of the rules.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384"
class="fnanchor">[384]</a> There was also an Amphiktyonic union at
Onchêstus in Bœotia, in the venerated grove and temple of Poseidôn:<a
id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>
of whom it consisted, we are not informed. These are some specimens
of the sort of special religious conventions and assemblies which
seem to have been frequent throughout Greece. Nor ought we to omit
those religious meetings and sacrifices which were common to all
the members of one Hellenic subdivision, such as the Pam-Bœotia
to all the Bœotians, celebrated at the temple of the Itonian
Athênê near Korôneia,<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386"
class="fnanchor">[386]</a>—the common observances, rendered to the
temple of Apollo Pythaëus at Argos, by all those neighboring towns
which had once been attached by this religious<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_246">[p. 246]</span> thread to the Argeians,—the similar
periodical ceremonies, frequented by all who bore the Achæan or
Ætolian name,—and the splendid and exhilarating festivals, so
favorable to the diffusion of the early Grecian poetry, which brought
all Ionians at stated intervals to the sacred island of Delos.<a
id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>
This latter class of festivals agreed with the Amphiktyony, in being
of a special and exclusive character, not open to all Greeks.</p>

<p>But there was one amongst these many Amphiktyonies, which, though
starting from the smallest beginnings, gradually expanded into so
comprehensive a character, and acquired so marked a predominance
over the rest, as to be called The Amphiktyonic Assembly, and
even to have been mistaken by some authors for a sort of federal
Hellenic Diet. Twelve sub-races, out of the number which made up
entire Hellas, belonged to this ancient Amphiktyony, the meetings
of which were held twice in every year: in spring, at the temple of
Apollo at Delphi; in autumn, at Thermopylæ, in the sacred precinct
of Dêmêtêr Amphiktyonis. Sacred deputies, including a chief called
the Hieromnêmôn, and subordinates called the Pylagoræ, attended at
these meetings from each of the twelve races: a crowd of volunteers
seem to have accompanied them, for purposes of sacrifice, trade, or
enjoyment. Their special, and most important function, consisted in
watching over the Delphian temple, in which all the twelve sub-races
had a joint interest; and it was the immense wealth and national
ascendency of this temple, which enhanced to so great a pitch the
dignity of its acknowledged administrators.</p>

<p>The twelve constituent members were as follows: Thessalians,
Bœotians, Dorians, Ionians, Perrhæbians, Magnêtes, Lokrians, Œtæans,
Achæans, Phokians, Dolopes, and Malians.<a id="FNanchor_388"
href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> All are<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span> counted as
<i>races</i>, (if we treat the Hellenes as a race, we must call these
<i>sub-races</i>,) no mention being made of cities:<a id="FNanchor_389"
href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> all count equally
in respect to voting, two votes being given by the deputies from
each of the twelve: moreover, we are told that, in determining the
deputies to be sent, or the manner in which the votes of each race
should be given, the powerful Athens, Sparta, and Thebes, had no more
influence than the humblest Ionian, Dorian, or Bœotian city. This
latter fact is distinctly stated by Æschines, himself a pylagore sent
to Delphi by Athens. And so, doubtless, the theory of the case stood:
the votes of the Ionic races counted for neither more nor less than
two, whether given by deputies from Athens, or from the small towns
of Erythræ and Priênê; and, in like manner, the Dorian votes were as
good in the division, when given by deputies from Bœon and Kytinion
in the little territory of Doris, as if the men delivering them had
been Spartans. But there can be as little question that, in practice,
the little Ionic cities, and the little Doric cities, pretended to no
share in the Amphyktionic deliberations. As the Ionic vote came to be
substantially the vote of Athens, so, if Sparta was ever obstructed
in the management of the Doric vote, it must have been by powerful
Doric cities like Argos or Corinth, not by the insignificant towns
of Doris. But the theory of Amphiktyonic suffrage, as laid down by
Æschines, however little realized in practice during his day, is
important, inasmuch as it shows in full evidence the primitive and
original constitution. The first establishment of the Amphyktionic
convocation dates from a time when all twelve members were on a
footing of equal independence, and when there were no overwhelming
cities (such as Sparta and Athens) to cast in the shade the humbler
members,—when Sparta was only one Doric city, and Athens only
one Ionic city, among various others of consideration, not much
inferior.</p>

<p>There are also other proofs which show the high antiquity of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p. 248]</span> this Amphiktyonic
convocation. Æschines gives us an extract from the oath which had
been taken by the sacred deputies, who attended on behalf of their
respective races, ever since its first establishment, and which still
apparently continued to be taken in his day. The antique simplicity
of this oath, and of the conditions to which the members bind
themselves, betrays the early age in which it originated, as well
as the humble resources of those towns to which it was applied.<a
id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
“We will not destroy any Amphiktyonic town,—we will not cut off any
Amphiktyonic town from running water,”—such are the two prominent
obligations which Æschines specifies out of the old oath. The second
of the two carries us back to the simplest state of society, and to
towns of the smallest size, when the maidens went out with their
basins to fetch water from the spring, like the daughters of Keleos
at Eleusis, or those of Athens from the fountain of Kallirrhoê.<a
id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
We may even conceive that the special mention of this detail, in
the covenant between the twelve races, is borrowed literally from
agreements still earlier, among the villages or little towns in
which the members of each race were distributed. At any rate, it
proves satisfactorily the very ancient date to which the commencement
of the Amphiktyonic convocation must be referred. The belief of
Æschines (perhaps, also, the belief general in his time) was, that it
commenced simultaneously with the first foundation of the Delphian
temple,—an event of which we have no historical knowledge; but there
seems reason to suppose that its original establishment is connected
with Thermopylæ and Dêmêtêr Amphiktyonis, rather than with Delphi
and Apollo. The special surname by which Dêmêtêr and her temple
at Thermopylæ was known,<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392"
class="fnanchor">[392]</a>—the temple of the hero Amphiktyon which
stood at its side,—the word Pylæ, which obtained footing in the
language to designate the half-yearly meeting of the deputies both at
Thermopylæ and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span>
Delphi,—these indications point to Thermopylæ (the real central point
for all the twelve) as the primary place of meeting, and to the
Delphian half-year as something secondary and superadded. On such a
matter, however, we cannot go beyond a conjecture.</p>

<p>The hero Amphiktyon, whose temple stood at Thermopylæ, passed in
mythical genealogy for the brother of Hellên. And it may be affirmed,
with truth, that the habit of forming Amphiktyonic unions, and of
frequenting each other’s religious festivals was the great means of
creating and fostering the primitive feeling of brotherhood among the
children of Hellên, in those early times when rudeness, insecurity,
and pugnacity did so much to isolate them. A certain number of
salutary habits and sentiments, such as that which the Amphiktyonic
oath embodies, in regard to abstinence from injury, as well as
to mutual protection,<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393"
class="fnanchor">[393]</a> gradually found their way into men’s
minds: the obligations thus brought into play, acquired a substantive
efficacy of their own, and the religious feeling which always
remained connected with them, came afterwards to be only one out of
many complex agencies by which the later historical Greek was moved.
Athens and Sparta in the days of their might, and the inferior cities
in relation to them, played each their own political game, in which
religious considerations will be found to bear only a subordinate
part.</p>

<p>The special function of the Amphiktyonic council, so far as we
know it, consisted in watching over the safety, the interests, and
the treasures of the Delphian temple. “If any one shall plunder
the property of the god, or shall be cognizant thereof, or shall
take treacherous counsel against the things in the temple, we
will punish him with foot, and hand, and voice, and by every
means in our power.” So ran the old Amphiktyonic oath, with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span> an energetic
imprecation attached to it.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394"
class="fnanchor">[394]</a> And there are some examples in
which the council<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395"
class="fnanchor">[395]</a> construes its functions so largely as
to receive and adjudicate upon complaints against entire cities,
for offences against the religious and patriotic sentiment of the
Greeks generally. But for the most part its interference relates
directly to the Delphian temple. The earliest case in which it
is brought to our view, is the Sacred War against Kirrha, in
the 46th Olympiad, or 595 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, conducted by
Eurylochus, the Thessalian, and Kleisthenes of Sikyôn, and proposed
by Solôn of Athens:<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396"
class="fnanchor">[396]</a> we find the Amphiktyons also, about half a
century afterwards, undertaking the duty of collecting subscriptions
throughout the Hellenic world, and making the contract with the
Alkmæonids for rebuilding the temple after a conflagration.<a
id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
But the influence of this council is essentially of a fluctuating
and intermittent character. Sometimes it appears forward to
decide, and its decisions command respect; but such occasions are
rare, taking the general course of known Grecian history; while
there are other occasions, and those too especially affecting
the Delphian temple, on which we are surprised to find nothing
said about it. In the long and perturbed period which Thucydidês
describes, he never once mentioned the Amphiktyons, though the
temple and the safety of its treasures form the repeated sub<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span>ject<a id="FNanchor_398"
href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> as well of dispute
as of express stipulation between Athens and Sparta: moreover, among
the twelve constituent members of the council, we find three—the
Perrhæbians, the Magnêtes, and the Achæans of Phthia—who were not
even independent, but subject to the Thessalians, so that its
meetings, when they were not matters of mere form, probably expressed
only the feelings of the three or four leading members. When one or
more of these great powers had a party purpose to accomplish against
others,—when Philip of Macedon wished to extrude one of the members
in order to procure admission for himself,—it became convenient to
turn this ancient form into a serious reality, and we shall see the
Athenian Æschines providing a pretext for Philip to meddle in favor
of the minor Bœotian cities against Thebes, by alleging that these
cities were under the protection of the old Amphiktyonic oath.<a
id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>It is thus that we have to consider the council as an element in
Grecian affairs,—an ancient institution, one amongst many instances
of the primitive habit of religious fraternization, but wider and
more comprehensive than the rest,—at first, purely religious, then
religious and political at once; lastly, more the latter than the
former,—highly valuable in the infancy, but unsuited to the maturity
of Greece, and called into real working only on rare occasions, when
its efficiency happened to fall in with the views of Athens, Thebes,
or the king of Macedon. In such special moments it shines with a
transient light which affords a partial pretence for the imposing
title bestowed on it by Cicero,—“commune Græciæ concilium:”<a
id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>
but we should com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[p.
252]</span>pletely misinterpret Grecian history if we regarded it as
a federal council, habitually directing or habitually obeyed. Had
there existed any such “commune concilium” of tolerable wisdom and
patriotism, and had the tendencies of the Hellenic mind been capable
of adapting themselves to it, the whole course of later Grecian
history would probably have been altered; the Macedonian kings would
have remained only as respectable neighbors, borrowing civilization
from Greece, and expending their military energies upon Thracians and
Illyrians; while united Hellas might even have maintained her own
territory against the conquering legions of Rome.</p>

<p>The twelve constituent Amphiktyonic races remained unchanged until
the Sacred War against the Phokians (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 355), after
which, though the number twelve was continued, the Phokians were
disfranchised, and their votes transferred to Philip of Macedon. It
has been already mentioned that these twelve did not exhaust the
whole of Hellas. Arcadians, Eleans, Pisans, Minyæ, Dryopes, Ætolians,
all genuine Hellens, are not comprehended in it; but all of them
had a right to make use of the temple of Delphi, and to contend
in the Pythian and Olympic games. The Pythian games, celebrated
near Delphi, were under the superintendence of the Amphiktyons,<a
id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
or of some acting magistrate chosen by and presumed to represent
them: like the Olympic games, they came round every four years (the
interval between one celebration and another being four complete
years, which the Greeks called a Pentaetêris): the Isthmian and
Nemean games recurred every two years. In its first humble form, of
a competition among bards to sing a hymn in praise of Apollo, this
festival was doubtless of immemorial antiquity;<a id="FNanchor_402"
href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> but the first
exten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span>sion of
it into Pan-Hellenic notoriety (as I have already remarked), the
first multiplication of the subjects of competition, and the first
introduction of a continuous record of the conquerors, date only
from the time when it came under the presidency of the Amphiktyons,
at the close of the Sacred War against Kirrha. What is called the
first Pythian contest coincides with the third year of the 48th
Olympiad, or 585 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> From that period forward, the
games become crowded and celebrated: but the date just named, nearly
two centuries after the first Olympiad, is a proof that the habit of
periodical frequentation of festivals, by numbers and from distant
parts, grew up but slowly in the Grecian world.</p>

<p>The foundation of the temple of Delphi itself reaches far beyond
all historical knowledge, forming one of the aboriginal institutions
of Hellas. It is a sanctified and wealthy place, even in the Iliad:
the legislation of Lykurgus at Sparta is introduced under its
auspices, and the earliest Grecian colonies, those of Sicily and
Italy in the eighth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, are established in
consonance with its mandate. Delphi and Dodona appear, in the most
ancient circumstances of Greece, as universally venerated oracles
and sanctuaries: and Delphi not only receives honors and donations,
but also answers questions, from Lydians, Phrygians, Etruscans,
Romans, etc.: it is not exclusively Hellenic. One of the valuable
services which a Greek looked for from this and other great religious
establishments was, that it should resolve his doubts in cases of
perplexity,—that it should advise him whether to begin a new, or to
persist in an old project,—that it should foretell what would be his
fate under given circumstances, and inform him, if suffering under
distress, on what conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[p.
254]</span> the gods would grant him relief. The three priestesses
of Dodona with their venerable oak, and the priestess of Delphi
sitting on her tripod under the influence of a certain gas or vapor
exhaling from the rock, were alike competent to determine these
difficult points: and we shall have constant occasion to notice in
this history, with what complete faith both the question was put and
the answer treasured up,—what serious influence it often exercised
both upon public and private proceeding.<a id="FNanchor_403"
href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The hexameter
verses, in which the Pythian priestess delivered herself, were,
indeed, often so equivocal or unintelligible, that the most serious
believer, with all anxiety to interpret and obey them, often found
himself ruined by the result; yet the general faith in the oracle
was noway shaken by such painful experience. For as the unfortunate
issue always admitted of being explained upon two hypotheses,—either
that the god had spoken falsely, or that his meaning had not been
correctly understood,—no man of genuine piety ever hesitated to adopt
the latter. There were many other oracles throughout Greece besides
Delphi and Dodona: Apollo was open to the inquiries of the faithful
at Ptôon in Bœotia, at Abæ in Phokis, at Branchidæ near Miletus, at
Patara in Lykia, and other places: in like manner, Zeus gave answers
at Olympia, Poseidôn at Tænarus, Amphiaraus at Thebes, Amphilochus at
Mallas, etc. And this habit of consulting the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_255">[p. 255]</span> oracle formed part of the still more
general tendency of the Greek mind to undertake no enterprise without
having first ascertained how the gods viewed it, and what measures
they were likely to take. Sacrifices were offered, and the interior
of the victim carefully examined, with the same intent: omens,
prodigies, unlooked-for coincidences, casual expressions, etc.,
were all construed as significant of the divine will. To sacrifice
with a view to this or that undertaking, or to consult the oracle
with the same view, are familiar expressions<a id="FNanchor_404"
href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> embodied in the
language. Nor could any man set about a scheme with comfort, until
he had satisfied himself in some manner or other that the gods were
favorable to it.</p>

<p>The disposition here adverted to is one of those mental analogies
pervading the whole Hellenic nation, which Herodotus indicates.
And the common habit among all Greeks, of respectfully listening
to the oracle of Delphi, will be found on many occasions useful in
maintaining unanimity among men not accustomed to obey the same
political superior. In the numerous colonies especially, founded
by mixed multitudes from distant parts of Greece, the minds of the
emigrants were greatly determined towards cordial coöperation by
their knowledge that the expedition had been directed, the œkist
indicated, and the spot either chosen or approved, by Apollo of
Delphi. Such in most cases was the fact: that god, according to the
conception of the Greeks, “takes delight always in the foundation
of new cities, and himself in person lays the first stone.”<a
id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>These are the elements of union—over and above the common
territory, described in the last chapter—with which the historical
Hellens take their start: community of blood, language, religious
point of view, legends, sacrifices, festivals,<a id="FNanchor_406"
href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> and also (with
certain allowances) of manners and character. The anal<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[p. 256]</span>ogy of manners and
character between the rude inhabitants of the Arcadian Kynætha<a
id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
and the polite Athens, was indeed accompanied with wide differences:
yet if we compare the two with foreign contemporaries, we shall
find certain negative characteristics, of much importance, common
to both. In no city of historical Greece did there prevail either
human sacrifices,<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408"
class="fnanchor">[408]</a>—or deliberate mutilation, such as cutting
off the nose, ears, hands, feet, etc.,—or castration,—or selling
of children into slavery,—or polygamy,—or the feeling of unlimited
obedience towards one man: all customs which might be pointed
out as existing among the contemporary Carthaginians, Egyptians,
Persians, Thracians,<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409"
class="fnanchor">[409]</a> etc. The habit of running, wrestling,
boxing, etc., in gymnastic contests, with the body perfectly
naked,—was common to all Greeks, having been first adopted as a
Lacedæmonian fashion in the fourteenth Olympiad: Thucydidês and
Herodotus remark, that it was not only not practised, but even
regarded as unseemly, among non-Hellens.<a id="FNanchor_410"
href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Of such customs,
indeed, at once common to all the Greeks, and peculiar to them<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span> as distinguished from
others, we cannot specify a great number; but we may see enough to
convince ourselves that there did really exist, in spite of local
differences, a general Hellenic sentiment and character, which
counted among the cementing causes of an union apparently so little
assured.</p>

<p>For we must recollect that, in respect to political sovereignty,
complete disunion was among their most cherished principles. The
only source of supreme authority to which a Greek felt respect and
attachment, was to be sought within the walls of his own city.
Authority seated in another city might operate upon his fears,—might
procure for him increased security and advantages, as we shall have
occasion hereafter to show with regard to Athens and her subject
allies,—might even be mildly exercised, and inspire no special
aversion: but, still, the principle of it was repugnant to the
rooted sentiment of his mind, and he is always found gravitating
towards the distinct sovereignty of his own boulê, or ekklêsia.
This is a disposition common both to democracies and oligarchies,
and operative even among the different towns belonging to the same
subdivision of the Hellenic name,—Achæans, Phokians, Bœotians, etc.
The twelve Achæan cities are harmonious allies, with a periodical
festival which partakes of the character of a congress,—but equal
and independent political communities: the Bœotian towns, under the
presidency of Thebes, their reputed metropolis, recognize certain
common obligations, and obey, on various particular matters, chosen
officers named bœotarchs,—but we shall see, in this, as in other
cases, the centrifugal tendencies constantly manifesting themselves,
and resisted chiefly by the interests and power of Thebes. That
great, successful, and fortunate revolution, which merged the several
independent political communities of Attica into the single unity
of Athens, took place before the time of authentic history: it is
connected with the name of the hero Theseus, but we know not how it
was effected, while its comparatively large size and extent, render
it a signal exception to Hellenic tendencies generally.</p>

<p>Political disunion—sovereign authority within the city walls—thus
formed a settled maxim in the Greek mind. The relation between one
city and another was an international relation,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_258">[p. 258]</span> not a relation subsisting between
members of a common political aggregate. Within a few miles from
his own city-walls, an Athenian found himself in the territory of
another city, wherein he was nothing more than an alien,—where
he could not acquire property in house or land, nor contract a
legal marriage with any native woman, nor sue for legal protection
against injury, except through the mediation of some friendly
citizen. The right of intermarriage, and of acquiring landed
property, was occasionally granted by a city to some individual
non-freeman, as matter of special favor, and sometimes (though
very rarely) reciprocated generally between two separate cities.<a
id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
But the obligations between one city and another, or between the
citizen of the one and the citizen of the other, are all matters of
special covenant, agreed to by the sovereign authority in each. Such
coexistence of entire political severance with so much fellowship
in other ways, is perplexing in modern ideas, and modern language
is not well furnished with expressions to describe Greek political
phenomena. We may say that an Athenian citizen was an <i>alien</i> when he
arrived as a visitor in Corinth, but we can hardly say that he was
a <i>foreigner</i>; and though the relations between Corinth and Athens
were in principle <i>international</i>, yet that word would be obviously
unsuitable to the numerous petty autonomies of Hellas, besides that
we require it for describing the relations of Hellenes generally with
Persians or Carthaginians. We are compelled to use a word such as
<i>interpolitical</i>, to describe the transactions between separate Greek
cities, so numerous in the course of this history.</p>

<p>As, on the one hand, a Greek will not consent to look for
sovereign authority beyond the limits of his own city, so, on the
other hand, he must have a city to look to: scattered villages will
not satisfy in his mind the exigencies of social order, security,
and dignity. Though the coalescence of smaller towns into a
larger is repugnant to his feelings, that of villages into a town
appears to him a manifest advance in the scale of civilization.
Such, at least, is the governing sentiment of Greece throughout
the historical period; for there was always a certain portion of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[p. 259]</span> Hellenic
aggregate—the rudest and least advanced among them—who dwelt in
unfortified villages, and upon whom the citizen of Athens, Corinth,
or Thebes, looked down as inferiors. Such village residence was the
character of the Epirots<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412"
class="fnanchor">[412]</a> universally, and prevailed throughout
Hellas itself, in those very early and even ante-Homeric times
upon which Thucydidês looked back as deplorably barbarous;—times
of universal poverty and insecurity,—absence of pacific
intercourse,—petty warfare and plunder, compelling every man to pass
his life armed,—endless migration without any local attachments. Many
of the considerable cities of Greece are mentioned as aggregations
of preëxisting villages, some of them in times comparatively
recent. Tegea and Mantineia in Arcadia, represent, in this way, the
confluence of eight villages, and five villages respectively; Dymê
in Achaia was brought together out of eight villages, and Elis in
the same manner, at a period even later than the Persian invasion;<a
id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
the like seems to have happened with Megara and Tanagra. A large
proportion of the Arcadians continued their village life down to
the time of the battle of Leuktra, and it suited the purposes of
Sparta to keep them thus disunited; a policy which we shall see
hereafter illustrated by the dismemberment of Mantineia (into its
primitive component villages), which Agesilaus carried into effect,
but which was reversed as soon as the power of Sparta was no longer
paramount,—as well as by the foundation of Megalopolis out of a large
number of petty Arcadian towns and villages, one of the capital
measures of Epameinondas.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414"
class="fnanchor">[414]</a> As this measure was an elevation of
Arcadian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span>
importance, so the reverse proceeding—the breaking up of a city
into its elementary villages—was not only a sentence of privation
and suffering, but also a complete extinction of Grecian rank and
dignity.</p>

<p>The Ozolian Lokrians, the Ætolians, and the Akarnanians
maintained their separate village residence down to a still later
period, preserving along with it their primitive rudeness and
disorderly pugnacity.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415"
class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Their villages were unfortified,
and defended only by comparative inaccessibility; in case of
need, they fled for safety with their cattle into the woods and
mountains. Amidst such inauspicious circumstances, there was no
room for that expansion of the social and political feelings to
which protected intramural residence and increased numbers gave
birth; there was no consecrated acropolis or agora,—no ornamented
temples and porticos, exhibiting the continued offerings of
successive generations,<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416"
class="fnanchor">[416]</a>—no theatre for music or recitation, no
gymnasium for athletic exercises,—none of those fixed arrangements,
for transacting public business with regularity and decorum, which
the Greek citizen, with his powerful sentiment of locality, deemed
essential to a dignified existence. The village was nothing more
than a fraction and a subordinate, appertaining as a limb to the
organized body called the city. But the city and the state<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[p. 261]</span> are in his mind,
and in his language, one and the same. While no organization less
than the city can satisfy the exigencies<a id="FNanchor_417"
href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> of an intelligent
freeman, the city is itself a perfect and self-sufficient whole,
admitting no incorporation into any higher political unity. It
deserves notice that Sparta, even in the days of her greatest power,
was not (properly speaking) a city, but a mere agglutination of
five adjacent villages, retaining unchanged its old-fashioned trim:
for the extreme defensibility of its frontier and the military
prowess of its inhabitants, supplied the absence of walls, while the
discipline imposed upon the Spartan, exceeded in rigor and minuteness
anything known in Greece. And thus Sparta, though less than a city
in respect to external appearance, was more than a city in respect
to perfection of drilling and fixity of political routine. The
contrast between the humble appearance and the mighty reality, is
pointed out by Thucydides.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418"
class="fnanchor">[418]</a> The inhabitants of the small territory of
Pisa, wherein Olympia is situated, had once enjoyed the honorable
privilege of administering the Olympic festival. Having been robbed
of it, and subjected by the more powerful Eleians, they took
advantage of various movements and tendencies among the larger
Grecian powers to try and regain it; and on one of these occasions,
we find their claim repudiated because they were villagers,
and unworthy of so great a distinction.<a id="FNanchor_419"
href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> There was nothing to
be called a city in the Pisatid territory.</p>

<p>In going through historical Greece, we are compelled to accept
the Hellenic aggregate with its constituent elements as a primary
fact to start from, because the state of our information does
not enable us to ascend any higher. By what circumstances, or
out of what preëxisting elements, this aggregate was brought
together and modified, we find no evidence entitled to credit.
There are, indeed, various names which are affirmed to designate
ante-Hellenic inhabitants of many parts of Greece,—the Pelasgi,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span> the Leleges, the
Kurêtes, the Kaukônes, the Aones, the Temmikes, the Hyantes,
the Telchines, the Bœotian Thracians, the Teleboæ, the Ephyri,
the Phlegyæ, etc. These are names belonging to legendary, not
to historical Greece,—extracted out of a variety of conflicting
legends, by the logographers and subsequent historians, who
strung together out of them a supposed history of the past, at a
time when the conditions of historical evidence were very little
understood. That these names designated real nations, may be true,
but here our knowledge ends. We have no well-informed witness to
tell us their times, their limits of residence, their acts, or
their character; nor do we know how far they are identical with
or diverse from the historical Hellens,—whom we are warranted in
calling, not, indeed, the first inhabitants of the country, but
the first known to us upon any tolerable evidence. If any man is
inclined to call the unknown ante-Hellenic period of Greece by
the name of Pelasgic, it is open to him to do so; but this is a
name carrying with it no assured predicates, noway enlarging our
insight into real history, nor enabling us to explain—what would be
the real historical problem—how or from whom the Hellens acquired
that stock of dispositions, aptitudes, arts, etc., with which they
begin their career. Whoever has examined the many conflicting
systems respecting the Pelasgi,—from the literal belief of Clavier,
Larcher, and Raoul Rochette, (which appears to me, at least, the
most consistent way of proceeding,) to the interpretative and
half-incredulous processes applied by abler men, such as Niebuhr, or
O. Müller, or Dr. Thirlwall,<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420"
class="fnanchor">[420]</a>—will not be displeased with my<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span> resolution to decline
so insoluble a problem. No attested facts are now present to us—none
were present to Herodotus and Thucydidês, even in their age—on which
to build trustworthy affirmations respecting the ante-Hellenic
Pelasgians. And where such is the case, we may without impropriety
apply the remark of Herodotus, respecting one of the theories
which he had heard for explaining the inundation of the Nile by
a supposed connection with the circumfluous Ocean,—that “the man
who carries up his story into the invisible world, passes out of
the range of criticism.”<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421"
class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>As far as our knowledge extends, there were no towns or villages
called Pelasgian, in Greece proper, since 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
But there still existed in two different places, even in the
age of Herodotus, people whom he believed to be Pelasgians. One
portion of these occupied the towns of Plakia and Skylakê near
Kyzikus, on the Propontis; another dwelt in a town called Krêstôn,
near the Thermaic gulf.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422"
class="fnanchor">[422]</a> There were, moreover, certain other
Pelasgian townships which he does not specify,—it seems, indeed,
from Thucydides, that there were some little Pelasgian townships on
the peninsula of Athos.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423"
class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Now, Herodotus acquaints us with the
remarkable fact, that the people of Krêstôn, those of Plakia and
Skylakê, and those of the other unnamed Pelasgian townships, all
spoke the same language, and each of them respectively a different
language from their neighbors around them.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_264">[p. 264]</span> He informs us, moreover, that their
language was a barbarous (<i>i. e.</i> a non-Hellenic) language; and this
fact he quotes as an evidence to prove that the ancient Pelasgian
language was a barbarous language, or distinct from the Hellenic. He
at the same time states expressly that he has no positive knowledge
what language the ancient Pelasgians spoke,—one proof, among others,
that no memorials nor means of distinct information concerning that
people, could have been open to him.</p>

<p>This is the one single fact, amidst so many conjectures concerning
the Pelasgians, which we can be said to know upon the testimony of
a competent and contemporary witness: the few townships—scattered
and inconsiderable, but all that Herodotus in his day knew as
Pelasgian—spoke a barbarous language. And upon such a point, he must
be regarded as an excellent judge. If, then, (infers the historian,)
all the early Pelasgians spoke the same language as those of Krêstôn
and Plakia, they must have changed their language at the time
when they passed into the Hellenic aggregate, or became Hellens.
Now, Herodotus conceives that aggregate to have been gradually
enlarged to its great actual size by incorporating with itself not
only the Pelasgians, but several other nations once barbarians;<a
id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> the
Hellens having been originally an inconsiderable people. Among those
other nations once barbarian, whom Herodotus supposes to have become
Hellenized, we may probably number the Leleges; and with respect to
them, as well as to the Pelasgians, we have contemporary testimony
proving the existence of barbarian Leleges in later times. Philippus,
the Karian historian, attested the present existence, and believed in
the past existence, of Leleges in his country, as serfs or dependent
cultivators under the Karians, analogous to the Helots in Laconia,
or the Penestæ in Thessaly.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425"
class="fnanchor">[425]</a> We may be very sure that there were no
Hellens—no men speaking the Hellenic tongue—standing in such a
relation to the Karians. Among those many barbaric-speaking<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span> nations whom Herodotus
believed to have changed their language and passed into Hellens, we
may, therefore, fairly consider the Leleges to have been included.
For next to the Pelasgians and Pelasgus, the Leleges and Lelex figure
most conspicuously in the legendary genealogies; and both together
cover the larger portion of the Hellenic soil.</p>

<p>Confining myself to historical evidence, and believing that no
assured results can be derived from the attempt to transform legend
into history, I accept the statement of Herodotus with confidence, as
to the barbaric language spoken by the Pelasgians of his day; and I
believe the same with regard to the historical Leleges,—but without
presuming to determine anything in regard to the legendary Pelasgians
and Leleges, the supposed ante-Hellenic inhabitants of Greece. And I
think this course more consonant to the laws of historical inquiry
than that which comes recommended by the high authority of Dr.
Thirlwall, who softens and explains away the statement of Herodotus,
until it is made to mean only that the Pelasgians of Plakia and
Krêstôn spoke a very bad Greek. The affirmation of Herodotus is
distinct, and twice repeated, that the Pelasgians of these towns, and
of his own time, spoke a barbaric language; and that word appears
to me to admit of but one interpretation.<a id="FNanchor_426"
href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> To suppose<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[p. 266]</span> that a man, who, like
Herodotus, had heard almost every variety of Greek, in the course
of his long travels, as well as Egyptian,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_267">[p. 267]</span> Phœnician, Assyrian, Lydian, and
other languages, did not know how to distinguish bad Hellenic from
non-Hellenic, is, in my judgment, inadmissible; at any rate, the
supposition is not to be adopted without more cogent evidence than
any which is here found.</p>

<p>As I do not presume to determine what were the antecedent
internal elements out of which the Hellenic aggregate was formed,
so I confess myself equally uninformed with regard to its external
constituents. Kadmus, Danaus, Kekrops,—the eponyms of the Kadmeians,
of the Danaans, and of the Attic Kekropia,—present themselves to my
vision as creatures of legend, and in that character I have already
adverted to them. That there may have been very early settlements in
continental Greece, from Phœnicia and Egypt, is nowise impossible;
but I see neither positive proof, nor ground for probable inference,
that there were any such, though traces of Phœnician settlements
in some of the islands may doubtless be pointed out. And if we
examine the character and aptitudes of Greeks, as compared either
with Egyptians or Phœnicians, it will appear that there is not only
no analogy, but an obvious and fundamental contrast: the Greek
may occasionally be found as a borrower from these ultramarine
contemporaries, but he cannot be looked upon as their offspring or
derivative. Nor can I bring myself to accept an hypothesis which
implies (unless we are to regard the supposed foreign emigrants as
very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span> few in
number, in which case the question loses most of its importance)
that the Hellenic language—the noblest among the many varieties of
human speech, and possessing within itself a pervading symmetry
and organization—is a mere confluence of two foreign barbaric
languages (Phœnician and Egyptian) with two or more internal barbaric
languages,—Pelasgian, Lelegian, etc. In the mode of investigation
pursued by different historians into this question of early foreign
colonies, there is great difference (as in the case of the Pelasgi)
between the different authors,—from the acquiescent Euemerism of
Raoul Rochette to the refined distillation of Dr. Thirlwall, in the
third chapter of his History. It will be found that the amount of
positive knowledge which Dr. Thirlwall guarantees to his readers in
that chapter is extremely inconsiderable; for though he proceeds upon
the general theory (different from that which I hold) that historical
matter may be distinguished and elicited from the legends, yet when
the question arises respecting any definite historical result, his
canon of credibility is too just to permit him to overlook the
absence of positive evidence, even when all intrinsic incredibility
is removed. That which I note as Terra Incognita, is in his view a
land which may be known up to a certain point; but the map which he
draws of it contains so few ascertained places as to differ very
little from absolute vacuity.</p>

<p>The most ancient district called Hellas is affirmed by Aristotle
to have been near Dôdôna and the river Achelôus,—a description which
would have been unintelligible (since the river does not flow near
Dôdôna), if it had not been qualified by the remark, that the river
had often in former times changed its course. He states, moreover,
that the deluge of Deukaliôn took place chiefly in this district,
which was in those early days inhabited by the Selli, and by the
people then called Græci, but now Hellenes.<a id="FNanchor_427"
href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> The Selli (called by
Pindar, Helli) are mentioned in the Iliad as the ministers of the
Dodonæan Zeus,—“men who slept on the ground, and never washed their
feet;” and Hesiod, in one of the lost poems (the Eoiai), speaks of
the fat land and rich pastures of the land called Hellopia, wherein
Dôdôna was situated.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428"
class="fnanchor">[428]</a> On<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p.
269]</span> what authority Aristotle made his statement, we do not
know; but the general feeling of the Greeks was different,—connecting
Deukaliôn, Hellen, and the Hellenes, primarily and specially
with the territory called Achaia Phthiôtis, between Mount Othrys
and Œta. Nor can we either affirm or deny his assertion that the
people in the neighborhood of Dôdôna were called Græci before they
were called Hellenes. There is no ascertained instance of the
mention of a people called Græci, in any author earlier than this
Aristotelian treatise; for the allusions to Alkman and Sophoklês
prove nothing to the point.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429"
class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Nor can we explain how it came to pass
that the Hellenes were known to the Romans only under the name
of Græci, or Graii. But the name by which a people is known to
foreigners is often completely different from its own domestic name,
and we are not less at a loss to assign the reason, how the Rasena
of Etruria came to be known to the Romans by the name of Tuscans, or
Etruscans.</p>

    NORTH OF PELOPONNESUS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">Having</span> in the preceding
chapter touched upon the Greeks in their aggregate capacity, I now
come to describe separately the portions of which this aggregate
consisted, as they present themselves at the first discernible period
of history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span>It has already
been mentioned that the twelve races or subdivisions, members of what
is called the Amphiktyonic convocation, were as follows:—</p>

<p>North of the pass of Thermopylæ,—Thessalians, Perrhæbians,
Magnêtes, Achæans, Melians, Ænianes, Dolopes.</p>

<p>South of the pass of Thermopylæ,—Dorians, Ionians, Bœotians,
Lokrians, Phokians.</p>

<p>Other Hellenic races, not comprised among the Amphiktyons,
were—</p>

<p>The Ætolians and Akarnanians, north of the gulf of Corinth.</p>

<p>The Arcadians, Eleians, Pisatans, and Triphylians, in the central
and western portion of Peloponnêsus: I do not here name the Achæans,
who occupied the southern or Peloponnesian coast of the Corinthian
gulf, because they may be presumed to have been originally of the
same race as the Phthiot Achæans, and therefore participant in the
Amphiktyonic constituency, though their actual connection with it may
have been disused.</p>

<p>The Dryopes, an inconsiderable, but seemingly peculiar
subdivision, who occupied some scattered points on the
sea-coast,—Hermionê on the Argolic peninsula; Styrus and Karystus in
Eubœa; the island of Kythnus, etc.</p>

<p>Though it may be said, in a general way, that our historical
discernment of the Hellenic aggregate, apart from the illusions of
legend, commences with 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, yet, with
regard to the larger number of its subdivisions just enumerated, we
can hardly be said to possess any specific facts anterior to the
invasion of Xerxes in 480 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Until the year
560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, (the epoch of Crœsus in Asia Minor,
and of Peisistratus at Athens,) the history of the Greeks presents
hardly anything of a collective character: the movements of each
portion of the Hellenic world begin and end apart from the rest. The
destruction of Kirrha by the Amphiktyons is the first historical
incident which brings into play, in defence of the Delphian temple, a
common Hellenic feeling of active obligation.</p>

<p>But about 560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, two important changes
are seen to come into operation, which alter the character of
Grecian history,—extricating it out of its former chaos of detail,
and centralizing its isolated phenomena: 1. The subjugation of
the Asiatic Greeks by Lydia and by Persia, followed by their
struggles for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[p. 271]</span>
emancipation,—wherein the European Greeks became implicated, first
as accessories, and afterwards as principals. 2. The combined
action of the large mass of Greeks under Sparta, as their most
powerful state and acknowledged chief, succeeded by the rapid and
extraordinary growth of Athens, the complete development of Grecian
maritime power, and the struggle between Athens and Sparta for
the headship. These two causes, though distinct in themselves,
must, nevertheless, be regarded as working together to a certain
degree,—or rather, the second grew out of the first. For it was the
Persian invasions of Greece which first gave birth to a wide-spread
alarm and antipathy among the leading Greeks (we must not call it
Pan-Hellenic, since more than half of the Amphiktyonic constituency
gave earth and water to Xerxes) against the barbarians of the East,
and impressed them with the necessity of joint active operations
under a leader. The idea of a leadership or hegemony of collective
Hellas, as a privilege necessarily vested in some one state for
common security against the barbarians, thus became current,—an idea
foreign to the mind of Solôn, or any one of the same age. Next,
came the miraculous development of Athens, and the violent contest
between her and Sparta, which should be the leader; the larger
portion of Hellas taking side with one or the other, and the common
quarrel against the Persian being for the time put out of sight.
Athens is put down, Sparta acquires the undisputed hegemony, and
again the anti-barbaric feeling manifests itself, though faintly,
in the Asiatic expeditions of Agesilaus. But the Spartans, too
incompetent either to deserve or maintain this exalted position, are
overthrown by the Thebans,—themselves not less incompetent, with
the single exception of Epameinondas. The death of that single man
extinguishes the pretensions of Thebes to the hegemony, and Hellas
is left, like the deserted Penelopê in the Odyssey, worried by the
competition of several suitors, none of whom is strong enough to
stretch the bow on which the prize depends.<a id="FNanchor_430"
href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Such a manifestation
of force, as well as the trampling down of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_272">[p. 272]</span> the competing suitors, is reserved,
not for any legitimate Hellenic arm, but for a semi-Hellenized<a
id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
Macedonian, “brought up at Pella,” and making good his encroachments
gradually from the north of Olympus. The hegemony of Greece thus
passes forever out of Grecian hands; but the conqueror finds his
interest in rekindling the old sentiment under the influence of which
it had first sprung up. He binds to him the discordant Greeks, by the
force of their ancient and common antipathy against the Great King,
until the desolation and sacrilege once committed by Xerxes at Athens
is avenged by annihilation of the Persian empire. And this victorious
consummation of Pan-Hellenic antipathy,—the dream of Xenophon<a
id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>
and the Ten Thousand Greeks after the battle of Kunaxa,—the hope of
Jason of Pheræ,—the exhortation of Isokratês,<a id="FNanchor_433"
href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>—the project of
Philip, and the achievement of Alexander,—while it manifests the
irresistible might of Hellenic ideas and organization in the then
existing state of the world, is at the same time the closing scene
of substantive Grecian life. The citizen-feelings of Greece become
afterwards merely secondary forces, subordinate to the preponderance
of Greek mercenaries under Macedonian order, and to the rudest of
all native Hellens,—the Ætolian mountaineers. Some few individuals
are indeed found, even in the third century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
worthy of the best times of Hellas, and the Achæan confederation of
that century is an honorable attempt to contend against irresistible
difficulties: but on the whole, that free, social, and political
march, which gives so much interest to the earlier centuries, is
irrevocably banished from Greece after the generation of Alexander
the Great.</p>

<p>The foregoing brief sketch will show that, taking the period
from Crœsus and Peisistratus down to the generation of Alexander
(560-300 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), the phenomena of Hellas generally,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p. 273]</span> her relations
both foreign and interpolitical, admit of being grouped together
in masses, with continued dependence on one or a few predominant
circumstances. They may be said to constitute a sort of historical
epopee, analogous to that which Herodotus has constructed out of
the wars between Greeks and barbarians, from the legends of Iô and
Eurôpa down to the repulse of Xerxes. But when we are called back to
the period between 776 and 560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the phenomena
brought to our knowledge are scanty in number,—exhibiting few common
feelings or interests, and no tendency towards any one assignable
purpose. To impart attraction to this first period, so obscure and
unpromising, we shall be compelled to consider it in its relation
with the second; partly as a preparation, partly as a contrast.</p>

<p>Of the extra-Peloponnesian Greeks north of Attica, during
these two centuries, we know absolutely nothing; but it will be
possible to furnish some information respecting the early condition
and struggles of the great Dorian states in Peloponnesus, and
respecting the rise of Sparta from the second to the first place
in the comparative scale of Grecian powers. Athens becomes first
known to us at the legislation of Drako and the attempt of Kylôn
(620 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) to make himself despot; and we gather
some facts concerning the Ionic cities in Eubœa and Asia Minor,
during the century of their chief prosperity, prior to the reign
and conquests of Crœsus. In this way, we shall form to ourselves
some idea of the growth of Sparta and Athens,—of the short-lived
and energetic development of the Ionic Greeks,—and of the slow
working of those causes which tended to bring about increased
Hellenic intercommunication,—as contrasted with the enlarged
range of ambition, the grand Pan-Hellenic ideas, the systematized
party-antipathies, and the intensified action, both abroad and at
home, which grew out of the contest with Persia.</p>

<p>There are also two or three remarkable manifestations which will
require special notice during this first period of Grecian history:
1. The great multiplicity of colonies sent forth by individual
cities, and the rise and progress of these several colonies; 2.
The number of despots who arose in the various Grecian cities; 3.
The lyric poetry; 4. The rudiments of that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span> which afterwards ripened into moral
philosophy, as manifested in gnomes, or aphorisms,—or the age of the
Seven Wise Men.</p>

<p>But before I proceed to relate those earliest proceedings
(unfortunately too few) of the Dorians and Ionians during the
historical period, together with the other matters just alluded to,
it will be convenient to go over the names and positions of those
other Grecian states respecting which we have no information during
these first two centuries. Some idea will thus be formed of the less
important members of the Hellenic aggregate, previous to the time
when they will be called into action. We begin by the territory north
of the pass of Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>Of the different races who dwelt between this celebrated pass
and the mouth of the river Peneius, by far the most powerful and
important were the Thessalians. Sometimes, indeed, the whole of
this area passes under the name of Thessaly,—since nominally,
though not always really, the power of the Thessalians extended
over the whole. We know that the Trachinian Herakleia, founded by
the Lacedæmonians in the early years of the Peloponnesian war,
close at the pass of Thermopylæ, was planted upon the territory
of the Thessalians.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434"
class="fnanchor">[434]</a> But there were also within these limits
other races, inferior and dependent on the Thessalians, yet
said to be of more ancient date, and certainly not less genuine
subdivisions of the Hellenic name. The Perrhæbi<a id="FNanchor_435"
href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> occupied the
northern portion of the territory between the lower course of the
river Peneius and Mount Olympus. The Magnêtes<a id="FNanchor_436"
href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> dwelt along the
eastern coast, between Mount Ossa and Pelion on one side and the
Ægean on the other, comprising the south-eastern cape and the eastern
coast of the gulf of Pagasæ as far as Iôlkos. The Achæans occupied
the territory called Phthiôtis, extending from near Mount Pindus
on the west to the gulf of Pagasæ on the east,<a id="FNanchor_437"
href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>—along the mountain
chain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span> of Othrys
with its lateral projections northerly into the Thessalian plain,
and southerly even to its junction with Œta. The three tribes of the
Malians dwelt between Achæa Phthiôtis and Thermopylæ, including both
Trachin and Herakleia. Westward of Achæa Phthiôtis, the lofty region
of Pindus or Tymphrêstus, with its declivities both westward and
eastward, was occupied by the Dolopes.</p>

<p>All these five tribes, or subdivisions,—Perrhæbians, Magnetes,
Achæans of Phthiôtis, Malians, and Dolopes, together with certain
Epirotic and Macedonian tribes besides, beyond the boundaries of
Pindus and Olympus,—were in a state of irregular dependence upon
the Thessalians, who occupied the central plain or basin drained
by the Peneius. That river receives the streams from Olympus,
from Pindus, and from Othrys,—flowing through a region which was
supposed by its inhabitants to have been once a lake, until Poseidôn
cut open the defile of Tempê, through which the waters found an
efflux. In travelling northward from Thermopylæ, the commencement
of this fertile region—the amplest space of land continuously
productive which Hellas presents—is strikingly marked by the
steep rock and ancient fortress of Thaumaki;<a id="FNanchor_438"
href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> from whence the
traveller, passing over the mountains of Achæa Phthiôtis and Othrys,
sees before him the plains and low declivities which reach northward
across Thessaly to Olympus. A narrow strip of coast—in the interior
of the gulf of Pagasæ, between the Magnêtes and the Achæans, and
containing the towns of Amphanæum and Pagasæ<a id="FNanchor_439"
href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>—belonged to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span> this proper territory
of Thessaly, but its great expansion was inland: within it were
situated the cities of Pheræ, Pharsalus, Skotussa, Larissa, Krannôn,
Atrax, Pharkadôn, Trikka, Metropolis, Pelinna, etc.</p>

<p>The abundance of corn and cattle from the neighboring plains
sustained in these cities a numerous population, and above
all a proud and disorderly noblesse, whose manners bore much
resemblance to those of the heroic times. They were violent in
their behavior, eager in armed feud, but unaccustomed to political
discussion or compromise; faithless as to obligations, yet at the
same time generous in their hospitalities, and much given to the
enjoyments of the table.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440"
class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Breeding the finest horses in Greece,
they were distinguished for their excellence as cavalry; but
their infantry is little noticed, nor do the Thessalian cities
seem to have possessed that congregation of free and tolerably
equal citizens, each master of his own arms, out of whom the ranks
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[p. 277]</span> hoplites were
constituted,—the warlike nobles, such as the Aleuadæ at Larissa, or
the Skopadæ at Krannon, despising everything but equestrian service
for themselves, furnished, from their extensive herds on the plain,
horses for the poorer soldiers. These Thessalian cities exhibit
the extreme of turbulent oligarchy, occasionally trampled down by
some one man of great vigor, but little tempered by that sense of
political communion and reverence for established law, which was
found among the better cities of Hellas. Both in Athens and Sparta,
so different in many respects from each other, this feeling will be
found, if not indeed constantly predominant, yet constantly present
and operative. Both of them exhibit a contrast with Larissa or Pheræ
not unlike that between Rome and Capua,—the former, with her endless
civil disputes constitutionally conducted, admitting the joint action
of parties against a common foe; the latter, with her abundant soil
enriching a luxurious oligarchy, and impelled according to the
feuds of her great proprietors, the Magii, Blossii, and Jubellii.<a
id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>The Thessalians are, indeed, in their character and capacity as
much Epirotic or Macedonian as Hellenic, forming a sort of link
between the two. For the Macedonians, though trained in aftertimes
upon Grecian principles by the genius of Philip and Alexander,
so as to constitute the celebrated heavy-armed phalanx, were
originally (even in the Peloponnesian war) distinguished chiefly
for the excellence of their cavalry, like the Thessalians;<a
id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
while the broad-brimmed hat, or kausia, and the short
spreading-mantle, or chlamys, were common to both.</p>

<p>We are told that the Thessalians were originally emigrants
from Thesprotia in Epirus, and conquerors of the plain of the
Peneius, which (according to Herodotus) was then called Æolis,
and which they found occupied by the Pelasgi.<a id="FNanchor_443"
href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> It may be
doubted whether the great Thessalian families,—such as the
Aleuadæ of Larissa, descendants from Hêraklês, and placed
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[p. 278]</span> Pindar
on the same level as the Lacedæmonian kings<a id="FNanchor_444"
href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>—would have admitted
this Thesprotian origin; nor does it coincide with the tenor of
those legends which make the eponym, Thessalus, son of Hêraklês.
Moreover, it is to be remarked that the language of the Thessalians
was Hellenic, a variety of the Æolic dialect;<a id="FNanchor_445"
href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> the same (so far as
we can make out) as that of the people whom they must have found
settled in the country at their first conquest. If then it be true
that, at some period anterior to the commencement of authentic
history, a body of Thesprotian warriors crossed the passes of Pindus,
and established themselves as conquerors in Thessaly, we must suppose
them to have been more warlike than numerous, and to have gradually
dropped their primitive language.</p>

<p>In other respects, the condition of the population of Thessaly,
such as we find it during the historical period, favors the
supposition of an original mixture of conquerors and conquered: for
it seems that there was among the Thessalians and their dependents
a triple gradation, somewhat analogous to that of Laconia. First,
a class of rich proprietors distributed throughout the principal
cities, possessing most of the soil, and constituting separate
oligarchies, loosely hanging together.<a id="FNanchor_446"
href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Next, the subject
Achæans, Magnêtes, Perrhæbi, differing from the Laconian Periœki in
this point, that they retained their ancient tribe-name and separate
Amphiktyonic franchise. Thirdly, a class of serfs, or dependent
cultivators, corresponding to the Laconian Helots, who, tilling
the lands of the wealthy oligarchs, paid over a proportion of its
produce, furnished the retainers by which these great families were
surrounded, served as their followers in the cavalry, and were in
a condition of villanage,—yet with the important reserve, that
they could not be sold out of the country,<a id="FNanchor_447"
href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> that they<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[p. 279]</span> had a permanent
tenure in the soil, and that they maintained among one another the
relations of family and village. This last mentioned order of men, in
Thessaly called the Penestæ, is assimilated by all ancient authors
to the Helots of Laconia, and in both cases the danger attending
such a social arrangement is noticed by Plato and Aristotle. For
the Helots as well as the Penestæ had their own common language
and mutual sympathies, a separate residence, arms, and courage;
to a certain extent, also, they possessed the means of acquiring
property, since we are told that some of the Penestæ were richer
than their masters.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448"
class="fnanchor">[448]</a> So many means of action, combined with a
degraded social position, gave rise to frequent revolt and incessant
apprehensions. As a general rule, indeed, the cultivation of the
soil by slaves, or dependents, for the benefit of proprietors in
the cities, prevailed throughout most parts of Greece. The rich
men of Thebes, Argos, Athens, or Elis, must have derived their
incomes in the same manner; but it seems that there was often, in
other places, a larger intermixture of bought foreign slaves, and
also that the number, fellow-feeling, and courage of the degraded
village population was nowhere so great as in Thessaly and Laconia.
Now the origin of the Penestæ, in Thessaly, is ascribed to the
conquest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p. 280]</span> the
territory by the Thesprotians, as that of the Helots in Laconia is
traced to the Dorian conquest. The victors in both countries are said
to have entered into a convention with the vanquished population,
whereby the latter became serfs and tillers of the land for the
benefit of the former, but were at the same time protected in their
holdings, constituted subjects of the state, and secured against
being sold away as slaves. Even in the Thessalian cities, though
inhabited in common by Thessalian proprietors and their Penestæ, the
quarters assigned to each were to a great degree separated: what was
called the Free Agora could not be trodden by any Penest, except
when specially summoned.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449"
class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>Who the people were, whom the conquest of Thessaly by the
Thesprotians reduced to this predial villanage, we find differently
stated. According to Theopompus, they were Perrhæbians and Magnêtes;
according to others, Pelasgians; while Archemachus alleged them to
have been Bœotians of the territory of Arnê,<a id="FNanchor_450"
href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>—some emigrating, to
escape the conquerors, others remaining and accepting the condition
of serfs. But the conquest, assuming it as a fact, occurred at far
too early a day to allow of our making out either the manner in
which it came to pass, or the state of things which preceded it.
The Pelasgians whom Herodotus saw at Krêstôn are affirmed by him to
have been the descendants of those who quitted Thessaly to escape<a
id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> the
invading Thesprotians; though others held that the Bœotians, driven
on this occasion from their habitations on the gulf of Pagasæ near
the Achæans of Phthiôtis, precipitated themselves on Orchomenus and
Bœotia, and settled in it, expelling the Minyæ and the Pelasgians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[p. 281]</span>Passing over
the legends on this subject, and confining ourselves to historical
time, we find an established quadruple division of Thessaly, said
to have been introduced in the time of Aleuas, the ancestor (real
or mythical) of the powerful Aleuadæ,—Thessaliôtis, Pelasgiôtis,
Histiæôtis, Phthiôtis.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452"
class="fnanchor">[452]</a> In Phthiôtis were comprehended the
Achæans, whose chief towns were Melitæa, Itônus, Thebæ, Phthiôtides,
Alos, Larissa, Kremastê, and Pteleon, on or near the western
coast of the gulf of Pagasæ. Histiæôtis, to the north of the
Peneius, comprised the Perrhæbians, with numerous towns strong
in situation, but of no great size or importance; they occupied
the passes of Olympus<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453"
class="fnanchor">[453]</a> and are sometimes considered as extending
westward across Pindus. Pelasgiôtis included the Magnêtes,
together with that which was called the Pelasgic plain, bordering
on the western side of Pelion and Ossa.<a id="FNanchor_454"
href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Thessaliôtis
comprised the central plain of Thessaly and the upper course of
the river Peneius. This was the political classification of the
Thessalian power, framed to suit a time when the separate cities
were maintained in harmonious action by favorable circumstances,
or by some energetic individual ascendency; for their union was
in general interrupted and disorderly, and we find certain cities
standing aloof while the rest went to war.<a id="FNanchor_455"
href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Though a certain
political junction, and obligations of some kind towards a common
authority, were recognized in theory by all, and a chief, or Tagus,<a
id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
was nominated to enforce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[p.
282]</span> obedience,—yet it frequently happened that the disputes
of the cities among themselves prevented the choice of a Tagus, or
drove him out of the country; and left the alliance little more than
nominal. Larissa, Pharsalus,<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457"
class="fnanchor">[457]</a> and Pheræ,—each with its cluster of
dependent towns as adjuncts,—seem to have been nearly on a par in
strength, and each torn by intestine faction, so that not only was
the supremacy over common dependents relaxed, but even the means
of repelling invaders greatly enfeebled. The dependence of the
Perrhæbians, Magnetes, Achæans, and Malians, might, under these
circumstances, be often loose and easy. But the condition of the
Penestæ—who occupied the villages belonging to these great cities, in
the central plain of Pelasgiôtis and Thessaliôtis, and from whom the
Aleuadæ and Skopadæ derived their exuberance of landed produce—was
noway mitigated, if it was not even aggravated, by such constant
factions. Nor were there wanting cases in which the discontent of
this subject-class was employed by members of the native oligarchy,<a
id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> or
even by foreign states, for the purpose of bringing about political
revolutions.</p>

<p>“When Thessaly is under her Tagus, all the neighboring people
pay tribute to her; she can send into the field six thousand
cavalry and ten thousand hoplites, or heavy-armed infantry,”<a
id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
observed Jason, despot of Pheræ, to Polydamas of Pharsalus, in
endeavoring to prevail on the latter to second his pretensions
to that dignity. The impost due from the tributaries, seemingly
considerable, was then realized with arrears, and the duties
upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p. 283]</span> imports
at the harbors of the Pagasæan gulf, imposed for the benefit of
the confederacy, were then enforced with strictness; but the
observation shows that, while unanimous Thessaly was very powerful,
her periods of unanimity were only occasional.<a id="FNanchor_460"
href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Among the nations
which thus paid tribute to the fulness of Thessalian power, we
may number not merely the Perrhæbi, Magnêtes, and Achæans of
Phthiôtis, but also the Malians and Dolopes, and various tribes of
Epirots extending to the westward of Pindus.<a id="FNanchor_461"
href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> We may remark that
they were all (except the Malians) javelin-men, or light-armed
troops, not serving in rank with the full panoply; a fact which, in
Greece, counts as presumptive evidence of a lower civilization: the
Magnêtes, too, had a peculiar close-fitting mode of dress, probably
suited to movements in a mountainous country.<a id="FNanchor_462"
href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> There was even
a time when the Thessalian power threatened to extend southward
of Thermopylæ, subjugating the Phokians, Dorians, and Lokrians.
So much were the Phokians alarmed at this danger, that they had
built a wall across the pass of Thermopylæ, for the purpose of
more easily defending it against Thessalian invaders, who are
reported to have penetrated more than once into the Phokian valleys,
and to have sustained some severe defeats.<a id="FNanchor_463"
href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> At what precise time
these events happened, we find no information; but it must have been
considerably earlier than the invasion of Xerxes, since the defensive
wall which had been built at Thermopylæ, by the Phokians, was found
by Leonidas in a state of ruin. But the Phokians, though they no
longer felt the necessity of keeping up this wall, had not ceased to
fear and hate the Thessalians,—an antipathy which will be found to
manifest itself palpably in connection with the Persian invasion.
On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[p. 284]</span> whole,
the resistance of the Phokians was successful, for the power of the
Thessalians never reached southward of the pass.<a id="FNanchor_464"
href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>It will be recollected that these different ancient races,
Perrhæbi, Magnêtes, Achæans, Malians, Dolopes,—though tributaries
of the Thessalians, still retained their Amphiktyonic franchise,
and were considered as legitimate Hellenes: all except the Malians
are, indeed, mentioned in the Iliad. We shall rarely have occasion
to speak much of them in the course of this history: they are
found siding with Xerxes (chiefly by constraint) in his attack
of Greece, and almost indifferent in the struggle between Sparta
and Athens. That the Achæans of Phthiôtis are a portion of the
same race as the Achæans of Peloponnesus it seems reasonable to
believe, though we trace no historical evidence to authenticate
it. Achæa Phthiôtis is the seat of Hellên, the patriarch of the
entire race,—of the primitive Hellas, by some treated as a town,
by others as a district of some breadth,—and of the great national
hero, Achilles. Its connection with the Peloponnesian Achæans
is not unlike that of Doris with the Peloponnesian Dorians.<a
id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
We have, also, to notice another ethnical kindred, the date and
circumstances of which are given to us only in a mythical form,
but which seems, nevertheless, to be in itself a reality,—that of
the Magnêtes on Pelion and Ossa, with the two divisions of Asiatic
Magnêtes, or Magnesia, on Mount Sipylus and Magnesia on the river
Mæander. It is said that these two Asiatic homonymous towns were
founded by migrations of the Thessalian Magnêtes, a body of whom
became consecrated to the Delphian god, and chose a new abode
under his directions. According to one story, these emigrants were
warriors, returning from the Siege of Troy; according to another,
they sought fresh seats, to escape from the Thesprotian conquerors of
Thessaly. There was a third story, according to which the Thessalian
Magnêtes themselves were represented as colonists<a id="FNanchor_466"
href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> from Delphi. Though
we can elicit no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[p. 285]</span>
distinct matter of fact from these legends, we may, nevertheless,
admit the connection of race between the Thessalian and the Asiatic
Magnêtes, as well as the reverential dependence of both, manifested
in this supposed filiation, on the temple of Delphi. Of the Magnêtes
in Krete, noticed by Plato as long extinct in his time, we cannot
absolutely verify even the existence.</p>

<p>Of the Malians, Thucydidês notices three tribes (γένη) as existing
in his time,—the Paralii, the Hierês (priests), and the Trachinii,
or men of Trachin:<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467"
class="fnanchor">[467]</a> it is possible that the second of the two
may have been possessors of the sacred spot on which the Amphiktyonic
meetings were held. The prevalence of the hoplites or heavy-armed
infantry among the Malians, indicates that we are stepping from
Thessalian to more southerly Hellenic habits: the Malians recognized
every man as a qualified citizen, who either had served, or was
serving, in the ranks with his full panoply.<a id="FNanchor_468"
href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Yet the panoply was
probably not perfectly suitable to the mountainous regions by which
they were surrounded; for, at the beginning of the Peloponnesian war,
the aggressive mountaineers of the neighboring region of Œta, had
so harassed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span>
overwhelmed them in war, that they were forced to throw themselves
on the protection of Sparta; and the establishment of the Spartan
colony of Herakleia, near Trachin, was the result of their urgent
application. Of these mountaineers, described under the general name
of Œtæans, the principal were the Ænianes, (or Eniênes, as they
are termed in the Homeric Catalogue, as well as by Herodotus),—an
ancient Hellenic<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469"
class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Amphiktyonic race, who are said to have
passed through several successive migrations in Thessaly and Epirus,
but who, in the historical times, had their settlement and their
chief town, Hypata, in the upper valley of the Spercheius, on the
northern declivity of Mount Œta. But other tribes were probably also
included in the name, such as those Ætolian tribes, the Bomians and
Kallians, whose high and cold abodes approached near to the Maliac
gulf. It is in this sense that we are to understand the name, as
comprehending all the predatory tribes along this extensive mountain
range, when we are told of the damage done by the Œtæans, both to
the Malians on the east, and to the Dorians on the south: but there
are some cases in which the name Œtæans seems to designate expressly
the Ænianes, especially when they are mentioned as exercising the
Amphiktyonic franchise.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470"
class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>The fine soil, abundant moisture, and genial exposure
of the southern declivities of Othrys,<a id="FNanchor_471"
href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>—especially the valley
of the Spercheius, through which river all these waters pass away,
and which annually gives forth a fertilizing inundation,—present a
marked contrast with the barren, craggy, and naked masses of Mount
Œta, which forms one side of the pass of Thermopylæ. Southward
of the pass, the Lokrians, Phokians, and Dorians, occupied the
mountains and passes between Thessaly and Bœo<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_287">[p. 287]</span>tia. The coast opposite to the western
side of Eubœa, from the neighborhood of Thermopylæ, as far as the
Bœotian frontier at Anthêdôn, was possessed by the Lokrians, whose
northern frontier town, Alpêni, was conterminous with the Malians.
There was, however, one narrow strip of Phokis—the town of Daphnus,
where the Phokians also touched the Eubœan sea—which broke this
continuity, and divided the Lokrians into two sections,—Lokrians of
Mount Knêmis, or Epiknemidian Lokrians, and Lokrians of Opus, or
Opuntian Lokrians. The mountain called Knêmis, running southward
parallel to the coast from the end of Œta, divided the former section
from the inland Phokians and the upper valley of the Kephisus:
farther southward, joining continuously with Mount Ptôon by means
of an intervening mountain which is now called Chlomo, it separated
the Lokrians of Opus from the territories of Orchomenus, Thebes, and
Anthêdôn, the north-eastern portions of Bœotia. Besides these two
sections of the Lokrian name, there was also a third, completely
separate, and said to have been colonized out from Opus,—the Lokrians
surnamed Ozolæ,—who dwelt apart on the western side of Phokis,
along the northern coast of the Corinthian gulf. They reached from
Amphissa—which overhung the plain of Krissa, and stood within seven
miles of Delphi—to Naupaktus. near the narrow entrance of the gulf;
which latter town was taken from these Lokrians by the Athenians, a
little before the Peloponnesian war. Opus prided itself on being the
mother-city of the Lokrian name, and the legends of Deukaliôn and
Pyrrha found a home there as well as in Phthiôtis. Alpeni, Nikæa,
Thronium, and Skarpheia, were towns, ancient but unimportant, of
the Epiknemidian Lokrians; but the whole length of this Lokrian
coast is celebrated for its beauty and fertility, both by Ancient
and modern observers.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472"
class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[p. 288]</span>The Phokians
were bounded on the north by the little territories called Doris and
Dryopis, which separated them from the Malians,—on the north-east,
east, and south-west, by the different branches of Lokrians,—and
on the south-east, by the Bœotians. They touched the Eubœan sea,
(as has been mentioned) at Daphnus, the point where it approaches
nearest to their chief town, Elateia; their territory also comprised
most part of the lofty and bleak range of Parnassus, as far as
its southerly termination, where a lower portion of it, called
Kirphis, projects into the Corinthian gulf, between the two bays
of Antikyra and Krissa; the latter, with its once fertile plain,
lay immediately under the sacred rock of the Delphian Apollo. Both
Delphi and Krissa originally belonged to the Phokian race, but the
sanctity of the temple, together with Lacedæmonian aid, enabled the
Delphians to set up for themselves, disavowing their connection
with the Phokian brotherhood. Territorially speaking, the most
valuable part of Phokis<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473"
class="fnanchor">[473]</a> consisted in the valley of the river
Kephisus, which takes its rise from Parnassus, not far from the
Phokian town of Lilæa, passes between Œta and Knêmis on one side,
and Parnassus on the other, and enters Bœotia near Chæroneia,
discharging itself into the lake Kôpaïs. It was on the projecting
mountain ledges and rocks on each side of this river, that the
numerous little Phokian towns were situated. Twenty-two of them
were destroyed and broken up into villages by the Amphiktyonic
order, after the second Sacred War; Abæ (one of the few, if not
the only one, that was spared) being protected by the sanctity of
its temple and oracle. Of these cities, the most important was
Elateia, situated on the left bank of the Kephisus, and on the
road from Lokris into Phokis, in the natural march of an army from
Thermopylæ into Bœotia. The Phokian towns<a id="FNanchor_474"
href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> were embodied in
an ancient confederacy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[p.
289]</span> which held its periodical meetings at a temple between
Daulis and Delphi.</p>

<p>The little territory called Doris and Dryopis, occupied the
southern declivity of Mount Œta, dividing Phokis on the north and
north-west, from the Ætolians, Ænianes, and Malians. That which
was called Doris in the historical times, and which reached,
in the time of Herodotus, nearly as far eastward as the Maliac
gulf, is said to have formed a part of what had been once called
Dryopis; a territory which had comprised the summit of Œta as
far as the Spercheius, northward, and which had been inhabited
by an old Hellenic tribe called Dryopes. The Dorians acquired
their settlement in Dryopis by gift from Hêraklês, who, along
with the Malians (so ran the legend), had expelled the Dryopes,
and compelled them to find for themselves new seats at Hermionê,
and Asinê, in the Argolic peninsula of Peloponnesus,—at Styra and
Karystus in Eubœa,—and in the island of Kythnus;<a id="FNanchor_475"
href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> it is only
in these five last-mentioned places, that history recognizes
them. The territory of Doris was distributed into four little
townships,—Pindus, or Akyphas, Bœon, Kytinion, and Erineon,—each
of which seems to have occupied a separate valley belonging to one
of the feeders of the river Kephisus,—the only narrow spaces of
cultivated ground which this “small and sad” region presented.<a
id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> In
itself, this tetrapolis is so insignificant, that we shall rarely
find occasion to mention it; but it acquired a factitious consequence
by being regarded as the metropolis of the great Dorian cities in
Peloponnesus, and receiving on that ground special protection from
Sparta. I do not here touch upon that string of ante-historical
migrations—stated by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[p.
290]</span> Herodotus, and illustrated by the ingenuity as well as
decorated by the fancy of O. Müller—through which the Dorians are
affiliated with the patriarch of the Hellenic race,—moving originally
out of Phthiôtis to Histiæôtis, then to Pindus, and lastly to Doris.
The residence of Dorians in Doris, is a fact which meets us at the
commencement of history, like that of the Phokians and Lokrians in
their respective territories.</p>

<p>We next pass to the Ætolians, whose extreme tribes covered
the bleak heights of Œta and Korax, reaching almost within sight
of the Maliac gulf, where they bordered on the Dorians and
Malians,—while their central and western tribes stretched along
the frontier of the Ozolian Lokrians to the flat plain, abundant
in marsh and lake, near the mouth of the Euênus. In the time of
Herodotus and Thucydidês, they do not seem to have extended so far
westward as the Achelôus; but in later times, this latter river,
throughout the greater part of its lower course, divided them
from the Akarnanians:<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477"
class="fnanchor">[477]</a> on the north, they touched upon the
Dolopians, and upon a parallel of latitude nearly as far north as
Ambrakia. There were three great divisions of the Ætolian name,—the
Apodôti, Ophioneis, and Eurytanes,—each of which was subdivided
into several different village tribes. The northern and eastern
portion of the territory<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478"
class="fnanchor">[478]</a> consisted of very high mountain ranges,
and even in the southern portion, the mountains Arakynthus, Kurion,
Chalkis, Taphiassus, are found at no great distance from the sea;
while the chief towns in Ætolia, Kalydôn, Pleurôn, Chalkis,—seem to
have been situated eastward of the Euênus, between the last-mentioned
mountains and the sea.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479"
class="fnanchor">[479]</a> The first two towns have been greatly
ennobled in legend, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p.
291]</span> are little named in history; while, on the contrary,
Thermus, the chief town of the historical Ætolians, and the place
where the aggregate meeting and festival of the Ætolian name, for the
choice of a Pan-Ætolic general, was convoked, is not noticed by any
one earlier than Ephorus.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480"
class="fnanchor">[480]</a> It was partly legendary renown, partly
ethnical kindred (publicly acknowledged on both sides) with the
Eleians in Peloponnesus, which authenticated the title of the
Ætolians to rank as Hellens. But the great mass of the Apodôti,
Eurytanes, and Ophioneis in the inland mountains, were so rude
in their manners, and so unintelligible<a id="FNanchor_481"
href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> in their speech,
(which, however, was not barbaric, but very bad Hellenic,) that
this title might well seem disputable,—in point of fact it was
disputed, in later times, when the Ætolian power and depredations
had become obnoxious nearly to all Greece. And it is, probably, to
this difference of manners between the Ætolians on the sea-coast and
those in the interior, that we are to trace a geographical division
mentioned by Strabo, into ancient Ætolia, and Ætolia Epiktêtus,
or acquired. When or by whom this division was introduced, we do
not know. It cannot be founded upon any conquest, for the inland
Ætolians were the most unconquerable of mankind: and the affirmation
which Ephorus applied to the whole Ætolian race,—that it had never
been reduced to subjection by any one,—is, most of all, beyond
dispute concerning the inland portion of it.<a id="FNanchor_482"
href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>Adjoining the Ætolians were the Akarnanians, the westernmost
of extra-Peloponnesian Greeks. They extended to the Ionian sea,
and seem, in the time of Thucydidês, to have occupied<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[p. 292]</span> both banks of the river
Achelôus, in the lower part of its course,—though the left bank
appears afterwards as belonging to the Ætolians, so that the river
came to constitute the boundary, often disputed and decided by arms,
between them. The principal Akarnanian towns, Stratus and Œniadæ,
were both on the right bank; the latter on the marshy and overflowed
land near its mouth. Near the Akarnanians, towards the gulf of
Ambrakia, were found barbarian, or non-Hellenic nations,—the Agræans
and the Amphilochians: in the midst of the latter, on the shores of
the Ambrakian gulf, the Greek colony, called Argos Amphilochicum, was
established.</p>

<p>Of the five Hellenic subdivisions now enumerated,—Lokrians,
Phokians, Dorians (of Doris), Ætolians, and Akarnanians (of whom
Lokrians, Phokians, and Ætolians are comprised in the Homeric
catalogue),—we have to say the same as of those north of Thermopylæ:
there is no information respecting them from the commencement of the
historical period down to the Persian war. Even that important event
brings into action only the Lokrians of the Eubœan sea, the Phokians,
and the Dorians: we have to wait until near the Peloponnesian war,
before we require information respecting the Ozolian Lokrians, the
Ætolians, and the Akarnanians. These last three were unquestionably
the most backward members of the Hellenic aggregate. Though not
absolutely without a central town, they lived dispersed in villages,
retiring, when attacked, to inaccessible heights, perpetually
armed and in readiness for aggression and plunder wherever they
found an opportunity.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483"
class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Very different was the condition of the
Lokrians opposite Eubœa, the Phokians, and the Dorians. These were
all orderly town communities, small, indeed, and poor, but not
less well administered than the average of Grecian townships, and
perhaps exempt from those individual violences which so frequently
troubled the Bœotian Thebes or the great cities of Thessaly.
Timæus affirmed (contrary, as it seems, to the supposition of
Aristotle) that, in early times, there were no<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span> slaves either among the Lokrians or
Phokians, and that the work required to be done for proprietors was
performed by poor freemen;<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484"
class="fnanchor">[484]</a> a habit which is alleged to have been
continued until the temporary prosperity of the second Sacred War,
when the plunder of the Delphian temple so greatly enriched the
Phokian leaders. But this statement is too briefly given, and too
imperfectly authenticated, to justify any inferences.</p>

<p>We find in the poet Alkman (about 610 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
the Erysichæan, or Kalydonian shepherd, named as a type of rude
rusticity,—the antithesis of Sardis, where the poet was born.<a
id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
And among the suitors who are represented as coming forward to
claim the daughter of the Sikyonian Kleisthenes in marriage, there
appears both the Thessalian Diaktoridês from Krannôn, a member of
the Skopad family,—and the Ætolian Malês, brother of that Titormus
who in muscular strength surpassed all his contemporary Greeks, and
who had seceded from mankind into the inmost recesses of Ætolia:
this Ætolian seems to be set forth as a sort of antithesis to the
delicate Smindyridês of Sybaris, the most luxurious of mankind.
Herodotus introduces these characters into his dramatic picture of
this memorable wedding.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486"
class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>Between Phokis and Lokris on one side, and Attica (from which
it is divided by the mountains Kithærôn and Parnês) on the other,
we find the important territory called Bœotia, with its ten or
twelve autonomous cities, forming a sort of confederacy under the
presidency of Thebes, the most powerful among them. Even of this
territory, destined during the second period of this history, to
play a part so conspicuous and effective, we know nothing during the
first two centuries after 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> We first acquire
some insight into it, on occasion of the disputes between Thebes
and Platæa, about the year 520 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Orchomenus, on
the north-west of the lake Kôpaïs, forms throughout the historical
times one of the cities of the Bœotian league, seemingly the second
after Thebes. But I have already stated that the Orcho<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span>menian legends, the
Catalogue, and other allusions in Homer, and the traces of past
power and importance yet visible in the historical age, attest
the early political existence of Orchomenus and its neighborhood
apart from Bœotia.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487"
class="fnanchor">[487]</a> The Amphiktyony in which Orchomenus
participated, at the holy island of Kalauria near the Argolic
peninsula, seems to show that it must once have possessed a naval
force and commerce, and that its territory must have touched the sea
at Halæ and the lower town of Larymna, near the southern frontier
of Lokris; this sea is separated by a very narrow space from the
range of mountains which join Knêmis and Ptôon, and which inclose
on the east both the basin of Orchomenus, Asplêdôn, and Kôpæ, and
the lake Kôpaïs. The migration of the Bœotians out of Thessaly into
Bœotia (which is represented as a consequence of the conquest of
the former country by the Thesprotians) is commonly assigned as the
compulsory force which Bœotized Orchomenus. By whatever cause, or
at whatever time (whether before or after 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>)
the transition may have been effected, we find Orchomenus completely
Bœotian throughout the known historical age,—yet still retaining
its local Minyeian legends, and subject to the jealous rivalry<a
id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>
of Thebes, as being the second city in the Bœotian league. The
direct road from the passes of Phokis southward into Bœotia went
through Chæroneia, leaving Lebadeia on the right, and Orchomenus on
the left hand, and passed the south-western edge of the lake<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span> Kôpaïs near the
towns of Koroneia, Alalkomenæ, and Haliartus,—all situated on the
mountain Tilphôssion, an outlying ridge connected with Helicon by the
intervention of Mount Leïbethrius. The Tilphossæon was an important
military post, commanding that narrow pass between the mountain
and the lake which lay in the great road from Phokis to Thebes.<a
id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>
The territory of this latter city occupied the greater part of
central Bœotia, south of the lake Kôpaïs; it comprehended Akræphia
and Mount Ptôon, and probably touched the Eubœan sea at the village
of Salganeus south of Anthêdôn. South-west of Thebes, occupying the
southern descent of lofty Helicon towards the inmost corner of the
Corinthian gulf, and bordering on the south-eastern extremity of
Phokis with the Phokian town of Bulis, stood the city of Thespiæ.
Southward of the Asôpus, between that river and Mount Kithæron, were
Platæa and Tanagra; in the south-eastern corner of Bœotia stood
Orôpus, the frequent subject of contention between Thebes and Athens;
and in the road between the Eubœan Chalkis and Thebes, the town of
Mykalêssus.</p>

<p>From our first view of historical Bœotia downward, there
appears a confederation which embraces the whole territory: and
during the Peloponnesian war, the Thebans invoke “the ancient
constitutional maxims of the Bœotians” as a justification of extreme
rigor, as well as of treacherous breach of the peace, against
the recusant Platæans.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490"
class="fnanchor">[490]</a> Of this confederation, the greater
cities were primary members, while the lesser were attached to one
or other of them in a kind of dependent union. Neither the names
nor the number of these primary members can be certainly known:
there seem grounds for including Thebes, Orchomenus, Lebadeia,
Korôneia, Haliartus, Kôpæ, Anthêdôn, Tanagra, Thespiæ, and Platæa
before its secession.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491"
class="fnanchor">[491]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[p.
296]</span> Akræphia, with the neighboring Mount Ptôon and its
oracle, Skôlus, Glisas, and other places, were dependencies of
Thebes: Chæroneia, Asplêdôn, Holmônes, and Hyêttus, of Orchomenus:
Siphæ, Leuktra, Kerêssus, and Thisbê, of Thespiæ.<a id="FNanchor_492"
href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Certain generals or
magistrates, called Bœotarchs, were chosen annually to manage the
common affairs of the confederation. At the time of the battle of
Delium in the Peloponnesian war, they were eleven in number, two of
them from Thebes; but whether this number was always maintained, or
in what proportions the choice was made by the different cities,
we find no distinct information. There were likewise, during the
Peloponnesian war, four different senates, with whom the Bœotarchs
consulted on matters of importance; a curious arrangement, of which
we have no explanation. Lastly, there was the general concilium and
religious festival,—the Pambœotia,—held periodically at Korôneia.
Such were the forms, as far as we can make them out, of the Bœotian
confederacy; each of the separate cities possessing its own senate
and constitution, and having its political consciousness as an
autonomous unit, yet with a certain habitual deference to the federal
obligations. Substantially, the affairs of the confederation will
be found in the hands of Thebes, managed in the interests of Theban
ascendency, which appears to have been sustained by no other feeling
except respect for superior force and bravery. The discontents of
the minor Bœotian towns, harshly repressed and punished, form an
uninviting chapter in Grecian history.</p>

<p>One piece of information we find, respecting Thebes singly
and apart from the other Bœotian towns anterior to the year 700
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Though brief, and incompletely recorded, it
is yet highly valuable, as one of the first incidents of solid and
positive Grecian history. Dioklês, the Corinthian, stands enrolled as
Olympic victor in the 13th Olympiad, or 728 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, at
a time when the oligarchy called Bacchiadæ possessed the government
of Corinth. The beauty of his person attracted towards him the
attachment of Philolaus, one of the members of this oligarchical
body,—a sentiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span>
which Grecian manners did not proscribe; but it also provoked an
incestuous passion on the part of his own mother, Halcyonê, from
which Dioklês shrunk with hatred and horror. He abandoned forever
his native city and retired to Thebes, whither he was followed
by Philolaus, and where both of them lived and died. Their tombs
were yet shown in the time of Aristotle, close adjoining to each
other, yet with an opposite frontage; that of Philolaus being so
placed that the inmate could command a view of the lofty peak of
his native city, while that of Dioklês was so disposed as to block
out all prospect of the hateful spot. That which preserves to us
the memory of so remarkable an incident, is, the esteem entertained
for Philolaus by the Thebans,—a feeling so profound, that they
invited him to make laws for them. We shall have occasion to point
out one or two similar cases, in which Grecian cities invoked the
aid of an intelligent stranger; and the practice became common,
among the Italian republics in the Middle Ages, to nominate a person
not belonging to their city either as podesta or as arbitrator in
civil dissensions. It would have been highly interesting to know,
at length, what laws Philolaus made for the Thebans; but Aristotle,
with his usual conciseness, merely alludes to his regulations
respecting the adoption of children and respecting the multiplication
of offspring in each separate family. His laws were framed with
the view to maintain the original number of lots of land, without
either subdivision or consolidation; but by what means the purpose
was to be fulfilled we are not informed.<a id="FNanchor_493"
href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> There existed a law
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span> Thebes, which
perhaps may have been part of the scheme of Philolaus, prohibiting
exposure of children, and empowering a father, under the pressure of
extreme poverty, to bring his new-born infant to the magistrates, who
sold it for a price to any citizen-purchaser,—taking from him the
obligation to bring it up, but allowing him in return, to consider
the adult as his slave.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494"
class="fnanchor">[494]</a> From these brief allusions, coming
to us without accompanying illustration, we can draw no other
inference, except that the great problem of population—the relation
between the well-being of the citizens and their more or less rapid
increase in numbers—had engaged the serious attention even of the
earliest Grecian legislators. We may, however, observe that the old
Corinthian legislator, Pheidôn, (whose precise date cannot be fixed)
is stated by Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495"
class="fnanchor">[495]</a> to have contemplated much the same object
as that which is ascribed to Philolaus at Thebes; an unchangeable
number both of citizens and of lots of land, without any attempt to
alter the unequal ratio of the lots, one to the other.</p>

    EARLIEST HISTORICAL VIEW OF PELOPONNESUS. DORIANS IN
    ARGOS AND THE NEIGHBORING CITIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">We now</span> pass from the
northern members to the heart and head of Greece,—Peloponnesus and
Attica, taking the former first in order, and giving as much as can
be ascertained respecting its early historical phenomena.</p>

<p>The traveller who entered Peloponnesus from Bœotia during the
youthful days of Herodotus and Thucydidês, found an array<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span> of powerful Doric
cities conterminous to each other, and beginning at the isthmus of
Corinth. First came Megara, stretching across the isthmus from sea
to sea, and occupying the high and rugged mountain-ridge called
Geraneia; next Corinth, with its strong and conspicuous acropolis,
and its territory including Mount Oneion as well as the portion of
the isthmus at once most level and narrowest, which divided its two
harbors called Lechæum and Kenchreæ. Westward of Corinth, along the
Corinthian gulf, stood Sikyôn, with a plain of uncommon fertility,
between the two towns: southward of Sikyôn and Corinth were Phlius
and Kleonæ, both conterminous, as well as Corinth, with Argos and the
Argolic peninsula. The inmost bend of the Argolic gulf, including a
considerable space of flat and marshy ground adjoining to the sea,
was possessed by Argos; the Argolic peninsula was divided by Argos
with the Doric cities of Epidaurus and Trœzen, and the Dryopian
city of Hermionê, the latter possessing the south-western corner.
Proceeding southward along the western coast of the gulf, and passing
over the little river called Tanos, the traveller found himself in
the dominion of Sparta, which comprised the entire southern region of
the peninsula from its eastern to its western sea, where the river
Neda flows into the latter. He first passed from Argos across the
difficult mountain range called Parnôn (which bounds to the west the
southern portion of Argolis), until he found himself in the valley
of the river Œnus, which he followed until it joined the Eurotas.
In the larger valley of the Eurotas, far removed from the sea, and
accessible only through the most impracticable mountain roads,
lay the five unwalled, unadorned, adjoining villages, which bore
collectively the formidable name of Sparta. The whole valley of the
Eurotas, from Skiritis and Beleminatis at the border of Arcadia, to
the Laconian gulf,—expanding in several parts into fertile plain,
especially near to its mouth, where the towns of Gythium and Helos
were found,—belonged to Sparta; together with the cold and high
mountain range to the eastward, which projects into the promontory of
Malea,—and the still loftier chain of Taygetus to the westward, which
ends in the promontory of Tænarus. On the other side of Taygetus, on
the banks of the river Pamisus, which there flows into the Messenian
gulf, lay the plain of Messênê, the richest land in the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p. 300]</span> peninsula. This plain
had once yielded its ample produce to the free Messenian Dorians,
resident in the towns of Stenyklêrus and Andania. But in the time of
which we speak, the name of Messenians was borne only by a body of
brave but homeless exiles, whose restoration to the land of their
forefathers overpassed even the exile’s proverbially sanguine hope.
Their land was confounded with the western portion of Laconia, which
reached in a south-westerly direction down to the extreme point of
Cape Akritas, and northward as far as the river Neda.</p>

<p>Throughout his whole journey to the point last mentioned, from the
borders of Bœotia and Megaris, the traveller would only step from
one Dorian state into another. But on crossing from the south to the
north bank of the river Neda, at a point near to its mouth, he would
find himself out of Doric land altogether: first, in the territory
called Triphylia,—next, in that of Pisa, or the Pisatid,—thirdly,
in the more spacious and powerful state called Elis; these three
comprising the coast-land of Peloponnesus from the mouth of the
Neda to that of the Larissus. The Triphylians, distributed into a
number of small townships, the largest of which was Lepreon,—and the
Pisatans, equally destitute of any centralizing city,—had both, at
the period of which we are now speaking, been conquered by their more
powerful northern neighbors of Elis, who enjoyed the advantage of a
spacious territory united under one government; the middle portion,
called the Hollow Elis, being for the most part fertile, though the
tracts near the sea were more sandy and barren. The Eleians were a
section of Ætolian emigrants into Peloponnesus, but the Pisatans and
Triphylians had both been originally independent inhabitants of the
peninsula,—the latter being affirmed to belong to the same race as
the Minyæ who had occupied the ante-Bœotian Orchomenos: both, too,
bore the ascendency of Elis with perpetual murmur and occasional
resistance.</p>

<p>Crossing the river Larissus, and pursuing the northern coast
of Peloponnesus south of the Corinthian gulf, the traveller would
pass into Achaia,—a name which designated the narrow strip of
level land, and the projecting spurs and declivities, between that
gulf and the northernmost mountains of the peninsula,—Skollis,
Erymanthus, Aroania, Krathis, and the towering eminence called<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[p. 301]</span> Kyllênê. Achæan
cities,—twelve in number at least, if not more,—divided this long
strip of land amongst them, from the mouth of the Larissus and the
north-western Cape Araxus on one side, to the western boundary of the
Sikyonian territory on the other. According to the accounts of the
ancient legends and the belief of Herodotus, this territory had once
been occupied by Ionian inhabitants whom the Achæans had expelled.</p>

<p>In making this journey, the traveller would have finished the
circuit of Peloponnesus; but he would still have left untrodden
the great central region, inclosed between the territories just
enumerated,—approaching nearest to the sea on the borders of
Triphylia, but never touching it anywhere. This region was Arcadia,
possessed by inhabitants who are uniformly represented as all of
one race, and all aboriginal. It was high and bleak, full of wild
mountain, rock, and forest, and abounding, to a degree unusual even
in Greece, with those land-locked basins from whence the water finds
only a subterraneous issue. It was distributed among a large number
of distinct villages and cities. Many of the village tribes,—the
Mænalii, Parrhasii, Azanes, etc., occupying the central and the
western regions, were numbered among the rudest of the Greeks: but
along its eastern frontier there were several Arcadian cities which
ranked deservedly among the more civilized Peloponnesians. Tegea,
Mantineia, Orchomenus, Stymphalus, Pheneus, possessed the whole
eastern frontier of Arcadia from the borders of Laconia to those
of Sikyôn and Pellênê in Achaia: Phigaleia at the south-western
corner, near the borders of Triphylia, and Heræa, on the north bank
of the Alpheius, near the place where that river quits Arcadia to
enter the Pisatis, were also towns deserving of notice. Towards the
north of this cold and thinly-peopled region, near Pheneos, was
situated the small town of Nonakris, adjoining to which rose the
hardly accessible crags where the rivulet of Styx<a id="FNanchor_496"
href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_302">[p. 302]</span> flowed down: a point of common feeling
for all Arcadians, from the terrific sanction which this water was
understood to impart to their oaths.</p>

<p>The distribution of Peloponnesus here sketched, suitable to the
Persian invasion and the succeeding half century, may also be said
(with some allowances) to be adapted to the whole interval between
about <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 550-370; from the time of the conquest
of Thyreatis by Sparta to the battle of Leuktra. But it is not the
earliest distribution which history presents to us. Not presuming
to criticize the Homeric map of Peloponnesus, and going back only
to 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, we find this material difference,—that
Sparta occupies only a very small fraction of the large territory
above described as belonging to her. Westward of the summit of Mount
Taygetus are found another section of Dorians, independent of Sparta:
the Messenian Dorians, whose city is on the hill of Stenyklêrus, near
the south-western boundary of Arcadia, and whose possessions cover
the fertile plain of Messêne along the river Pamisus to its mouth
in the Messenian gulf: it is to be noted that Messênê was then the
name of the plain generally, and that no town so called existed until
after the battle of Leuktra. Again, eastward of the valley of the
Eurotas, the mountainous region and the western shores of the Argolic
gulf down to Cape Malea are also independent of Sparta; belonging
to Argos, or rather to Dorian towns in unison with Argos. All the
great Dorian towns, from the borders of the Megarid to the eastern
frontier of Arcadia, as above enumerated, appear to have existed in
776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>: Achaia was in the same condition, so far
as we are able to judge, as well as Arcadia, except in regard to
its southern frontier, conterminous with Sparta, of which more will
hereafter be said. In respect to the western portion of Peloponnesus,
Elis (properly so called) appears to have embraced the same<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[p. 303]</span> territory in 776
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> as in 550 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>: but the Pisatid
had been recently conquered, and was yet imperfectly subjected by
the Eleians; while Triphylia seems to have been quite independent of
them. Respecting the south-western promontory of Peloponnesus down
to Cape Akritas, we are altogether without information: reasons will
hereafter be given for believing that it did not at that time form
part of the territory of the Messenian Dorians.</p>

<p>Of the different races or people whom Herodotus knew in
Peloponnesus, he believed three to be aboriginal,—the Arcadians,
the Achæans, and the Kynurians. The Achæans, though belonging
indigenously to the peninsula, had yet removed from the southern
portion of it to the northern, expelling the previous Ionian tenants:
this is a part of the legend respecting the Dorian conquest, or
Return of the Herakleids, and we can neither verify nor contradict
it. But neither the Arcadians nor the Kynurians had ever changed
their abodes. Of the latter, I have not before spoken, because
they were never (so far as history knows them) an independent
population. They occupied the larger portion<a id="FNanchor_497"
href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> of the territory
of Argolis, from Orneæ, near the northern<a id="FNanchor_498"
href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> or Phliasian border,
to Thyrea and the Thyreatis, on the Laconian border: and though
belonging originally (as Herodotus imagines rather than asserts)
to the Ionic race—they had been so long subjects of Argos in his
time, that almost all evidence of their ante-Dorian condition had
vanished.</p>

<p>But the great Dorian states in Peloponnesus—the capital powers
in the peninsula—were all originally emigrants, according to the
belief not only of Herodotus, but of all the Grecian world: so also
were the Ætolians of Elis, the Triphylians, and the Dryopes at
Hermionê and Asinê. All these emigrations are so described as to
give them a root in the Grecian legendary world: the Triphylians are
traced back to Lemnos, as the offspring of the Argonautic heroes,<a
id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
and we are too uninformed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[p.
304]</span> about them to venture upon any historical guesses. But
respecting the Dorians, it may perhaps be possible, by examining
the first historical situation in which they are presented to us,
to offer some conjectures as to the probable circumstances under
which they arrived. The legendary narrative of it has already been
given in the first chapter of this volume,—that great mythical event
called the Return of the Children of Hêraklês, by which the first
establishment of the Dorians in the promised land of Peloponnesus
was explained to the full satisfaction of Grecian faith. One
single armament and expedition, acting by the special direction
of the Delphian god, and conducted by three brothers, lineal
descendants of the principal Achæo-Dorian heroes through Hyllus,
(the eponymus of the principal tribe,)—the national heroes of the
preëxisting population vanquished and expelled, and the greater part
of the peninsula both acquired and partitioned at a stroke,—the
circumstances of the partition adjusted to the historical relations
of Laconia and Messenia,—the friendly power of Ætolian Elis, with its
Olympic games as the bond of union in Peloponnesus, attached to this
event as an appendage, in the person of Oxylus,—all these particulars
compose a narrative well calculated to impress the retrospective
imagination of a Greek. They exhibit an epical fitness and
sufficiency which it would be unseasonable to impair by historical
criticism.</p>

<p>The Alexandrine chronology sets down a period of 328 years
from the Return of the Herakleids to the first Olympiad (1104
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>-776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,),—a period
measured by the lists of the kings of Sparta, on the trustworthiness
of which some remarks have already been offered. Of these 328 years,
the first 250, at the least, are altogether barren of facts; and
even if we admitted them to be historical, we should have nothing
to recount except a succession of royal names. Being unable either
to guarantee the entire list, or to discover any valid test for
discriminating the historical and the non-historical items, I here
enumerate the Lacedæmonian kings as they appear in Mr. Clinton’s
Fasti Hellenici. There were two joint kings at Sparta, throughout
nearly all the historical time of independent Greece, deducing
their descent from Hêraklês through Eurysthenês and Proklês, the
twin sons of Aristodêmus; the latter being one of those three<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[p. 305]</span> Herakleid brothers to
whom the conquest of the peninsula is ascribed:—</p>

<p class="mt1">Both Theopompus and Alkamenês reigned considerably
longer, but the chronologists affirm that the year 776
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> (or the first Olympiad) occurred in the
tenth year of each of their reigns. It is necessary to add, with
regard to this list, that there are some material discrepancies
between different authors even as to the names of individual kings,
and still more as to the duration of their reigns, as may be seen
both in Mr. Clinton’s chronology and in Müller’s Appendix to the
History of the Dorians.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500"
class="fnanchor">[500]</a> The alleged sum total cannot be made
to agree with the items without great license of conjecture.
O. Müller observes,<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501"
class="fnanchor">[501]</a> in reference to this Alexandrine
chronology, “that our materials only enable us to restore it to its
original state, not to verify its correctness.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_306">[p. 306]</span>” In point of fact they are insufficient
even for the former purpose, as the dissensions among learned critics
attest.</p>

<p>We have a succession of names, still more barren of facts, in
the case of the Dorian sovereigns of Corinth. This city had its own
line of Herakleids, descended from Hêraklês, but not through Hyllus.
Hippotês, the progenitor of the Corinthian Herakleids, was reported
in the legend to have originally joined the Dorian invaders of the
Peloponnesus, but to have quitted them in consequence of having
slain the prophet Karnus.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502"
class="fnanchor">[502]</a> The three brothers, when they became
masters of the peninsula, sent for Alêtês, the son of Hippotês, and
placed him in possession of Corinth, over which the chronologists
make him begin to reign thirty years after the Herakleid conquest.
His successors are thus given:—</p>

307]</span>Such was the celebrity of Bacchis, we are told, that those
who succeeded him took the name of Bacchiads in place of Aletiads or
Herakleids. One year after the accession of Automenês, the family
of the Bacchiads generally, amounting to 200 persons, determined to
abolish royalty, to constitute themselves a standing oligarchy, and
to elect out of their own number an annual Prytanis. Thus commenced
the oligarchy of the Bacchiads, which lasted for ninety years,
until it was subverted by Kypselus in 657 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a

Reckoning the thirty years previous to the beginning of the reign
of Alêtês, the chronologists thus provide an interval of 447 years
between the Return of the Herakleids and the accession of Kypselus,
and 357 years between the same period and the commencement of
the Bacchiad oligarchy. The Bacchiad oligarchy is unquestionably
historical; the conquest of the Herakleids belongs to the legendary
world; while the interval between the two is filled up, as in so many
other cases, by a mere barren genealogy.</p>

<p>When we jump this vacant space, and place ourselves at the first
opening of history, we find that, although ultimately Sparta came to
hold the first place, not only in Peloponnesus, but in all Hellas,
this was not the case at the earliest moment of which we have
historical cognizance. Argos, and the neighboring towns connected
with her by a bond of semi-religious, semi-political union,—Sikyôn,
Phlius, Epidaurus, and Trœzên,—were at first of greater power
and consideration than Sparta; a fact which the legend of the
Herakleids seems to recognize by making Tê<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_308">[p. 308]</span>menus the eldest brother of the three.
And Herodotus assures us that at one time all the eastern coast of
Peloponnesus down to Cape Melea, including the island of Cythêra,
all which came afterwards to constitute a material part of Laconia,
had belonged to Argos.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504"
class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Down to the time of the first Messenian
war, the comparative importance of the Dorian establishments in
Peloponnesus appears to have been in the order in which the legend
placed them,—Argos first,<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505"
class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Sparta second, Messênê third. It will be
seen hereafter that the Argeians never lost the recollection of this
early preëminence, from which the growth of Sparta had extruded them;
and the liberties of entire Hellas were more than once in danger from
their disastrous jealousy of a more fortunate competitor.</p>

<p>At a short distance of about three miles from Argos, and at
the exact point where that city approaches nearest to the sea,<a
id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> was
situated the isolated hillock called Temenion, noticed both by Strabo
and Pausanias. It was a small village, deriving both its name and
its celebrity from the chapel and tomb of the hero Têmenus, who was
there worshipped by the Dorians; and the statement which Pausanias
heard was, that Têmenus, with his invading Dorians, had seized and
fortified the spot, and employed it as an armed post to make war
upon Tisamenus and the Achæans. What renders this report deserving
of the greater attention, is, that the same thing is affirmed with
regard to the eminence called Solygeius, near Corinth: this too was
believed to be the place which the Dorian assailants had occupied
and fortified against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[p.
309]</span> the preëxisting Corinthians in the city. Situated close
upon the Sarônic gulf, it was the spot which invaders landing from
that gulf would naturally seize upon, and which Nikias with his
powerful Athenian fleet did actually seize and occupy against Corinth
in the Peloponnesian war.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507"
class="fnanchor">[507]</a> In early days, the only way of
overpowering the inhabitants of a fortified town, generally also
planted in a position itself very defensible, was,—that the
invaders, entrenching themselves in the neighborhood, harassed the
inhabitants and ruined their produce until they brought them to
terms. Even during the Peloponnesian war, when the art of besieging
had made some progress, we read of several instances in which this
mode of aggressive warfare was adopted with efficient results.<a
id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
We may readily believe that the Dorians obtained admittance both
into Argos and Corinth in this manner. And it is remarkable that,
except Sikyôn (which is affirmed to have been surprised by night),
these were the only towns in the Argolic region which are said to
have resisted them; the story being, that Phlius, Epidaurus, and
Trœzên had admitted the Dorian intruders without opposition, although
a certain portion of the previous inhabitants seceded. We shall
hereafter see that the non-Dorian population of Sikyôn and Corinth
still remained considerable.</p>

<p>The separate statements which we thus find, and the position of
the Temenion and the Solygeius, lead to two conjectures,—first, that
the acquisitions of the Dorians in Peloponnesus were also isolated
and gradual, not at all conformable to the rapid strides of the
old Herakleid legend; next, that the Dorian invaders of Argos and
Corinth made their attack from the Argolic and the Saronic gulfs,—by
sea and not by land. It is, indeed, difficult to see how they can
have got to the Temenion in any other way than by sea; and a glance
at the map will show that the eminence Solygeius presents itself,<a
id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>
with reference to Corinth, as the nearest and most convenient
holding-ground for a maritime invader, conformably to the scheme
of operations laid by Nikias. To illustrate the supposition of a
Dorian attack by sea on Corinth, we may refer to a story quoted from
Aristotle (which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[p. 310]</span>
we find embodied in the explanation of an old adage), representing
Hippotês the father of Alêtês as having crossed the Maliac gulf<a
id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
(the sea immediately bordering on the ancient Maleans, Dryopians,
and Dorians) in ships, for the purpose of colonizing. And if it be
safe to trust the mention of Dorians in the Odyssey, as a part of
the population of the island of Crete, we there have an example of
Dorian settlements which must have been effected by sea, and that
too at a very early period. “We must suppose (observes O. Müller,<a
id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> in
reference to these Kretan Dorians) that the Dorians, pressed by want
or restless from inactivity, constructed piratical canoes, manned
these frail and narrow barks with soldiers who themselves worked at
the oar, and thus being changed from mountaineers into seamen,—the
Normans of Greece,—set sail for the distant island of Krête.” In the
same manner, we may conceive the expeditions of the Dorians against
Argos and Corinth to have been effected; and whatever difficulties
may attach to this hypothesis, certain it is that the difficulties of
a long land-march, along such a territory as Greece, are still more
serious.</p>

<p>The supposition of Dorian emigrations by sea, from the Maliac
gulf to the north-eastern promontory of Peloponnesus, is farther
borne out by the analogy of the Dryopes, or Dryopians. During
the historical times, this people occupied several detached
settlements in various parts of Greece, all maritime, and some
insular;—they were found at Hermionê, Asinê, and Eiôn, in the
Argolic peninsula (very near to the important Dorian towns<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[p. 311]</span> constituting the
Amphiktyony of Argos,<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512"
class="fnanchor">[512]</a>)—at Styra and Karystus in the island of
Eubœa,—in the island of Kythnus, and even at Cyprus. These dispersed
colonies can only have been planted by expeditions over the sea. Now
we are told that the original Dryopis, the native country of this
people, comprehended both the territory near the river Spercheius,
and north of Œta, afterwards occupied by the Malians, as well as
the neighboring district south of Œta, which was afterwards called
Doris. From hence the Dryopians were expelled,—according to one
story, by the Dorians,—according to another, by Hêraklês and the
Malians: however this may be, it was from the Maliac gulf that they
started on shipboard in quest of new homes, which some of them found
on the headlands of the Argolic peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_513"
href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> And it was from
this very country, according to Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_514"
href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> that the Dorians
also set forth, in order to reach Peloponnesus. Nor does it seem
unreasonable to imagine, that the same means of conveyance, which
bore the Dryopians from the Maliac gulf to Hermionê and Asinê, also
carried the Dorians from the same place to the Temenion, and the hill
Solygeius.</p>

<p>The legend represents Sikyôn, Epidaurus, Trœzên, Phlius, and
Kleônæ, as all occupied by Dorian colonists from Argos, under the
different sons of Têmenus: the first three are on the sea, and fit
places for the occupation of maritime invaders. Argos and the Dorian
towns in and near the Argolic peninsula are to be regarded as a
cluster of settlements by themselves, completely distinct from Sparta
and the Messenian Stenyklêrus, which appear to have been formed
under totally different conditions. First, both of them are very far
inland,—Stenyklêrus not easy, Sparta very difficult of access from
the sea; next, we know that the conquests of Sparta were gradually
made down the valley of the Eurotas seaward. Both these acquisitions
present the appearance of having been made from the land-side,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[p. 312]</span> perhaps in
the direction which the Herakleid legend describes,—by warriors
entering Peloponnesus across the narrow mouth of the Corinthian
gulf, through the aid or invitation of those Ætolian settlers who at
the same time colonized Elis. The early and intimate connection (on
which I shall touch presently) between Sparta and the Olympic games
as administered by the Eleians, as well as the leading part ascribed
to Lykurgus in the constitution of the solemn Olympic truce, tend to
strengthen such a persuasion.</p>

<p>In considering the early affairs of the Dorians in Peloponnesus,
we are apt to have our minds biased, first, by the Herakleid legend,
which imparts to them an impressive, but deceitful, epical unity;
next, by the aspect of the later and better-known history, which
presents the Spartan power as unquestionably preponderant, and
Argos only as second by a long interval. But the first view (as I
have already remarked) which opens to us, of real Grecian history,
a little before 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, exhibits Argos with its
alliance or confederacy of neighboring cities colonized from itself,
as the great seat of Dorian power in the peninsula, and Sparta as
an outlying state of inferior consequence. The recollection of this
state of things lasted after it had ceased to be a reality, and kept
alive pretensions on the part of Argos to the headship of the Greeks
as a matter of right, which she became quite incapable of sustaining
either by adequate power or by statesmanlike sagacity. The growth
of Spartan power was a succession of encroachments upon Argos.<a
id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>How Sparta came constantly to gain upon Argos will be matter
for future explanation: at present, it is sufficient to remark,
that the ascendency of Argos was derived not exclusively from
her own territory, but came in part from her position as
metropolis of an alliance of autonomous neighboring cities, all
Dorian and all colonized from herself,—and this was an element
of power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[p. 313]</span>
essentially fluctuating. What Thêbes was to the cities of Bœotia,
of which she either was, or professed to have been, the founder,<a
id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> the
same was Argos in reference to Kleônæ, Phlius, Sikyôn, Epidaurus,
Trœzên, and Ægina. These towns formed, in mythical language,
“the lot of Têmenus,”<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517"
class="fnanchor">[517]</a>—in real matter of fact, the confederated
allies or subordinates of Argos: the first four of them were said
to have been <i>Dorized</i> by the sons or immediate relatives of
Têmenus; and the kings of Argos, as acknowledged descendants of
the latter, claimed and exercised a sort of <i>suzeraineté</i> over
them. Hermionê, Asinê, and Nauplia seem also to have been under
the supremacy of Argos, though not colonies.<a id="FNanchor_518"
href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> But this supremacy
was not claimed directly and nakedly: agreeably to the ideas of
the time, the ostensible purposes of the Argeian confederacy or
Amphiktyony were religious, though its secondary and not less
real effects, were political. The great patron-god of the league
was Apollo Pythaëus, in whose name the obligations incumbent on
the members of the league were imposed. While in each of the
confederated cities there was a temple to this god, his most holy
and central sanctuary was on the Larissa or acropolis of Argos.
At this central Argeian sanctuary, solemn sacrifices were offered
by Epidaurus as well as by other members of the confederacy, and,
as it should seem, accompanied by<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_314">[p. 314]</span> money-payments,<a id="FNanchor_519"
href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>—which the Argeians,
as chief administrators on behalf of the common god, took upon them
to enforce against defaulters, and actually tried to enforce during
the Peloponnesian war against Epidaurus. On another occasion, during
the 66th Olympiad (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 514), they imposed the large
fine of 500 talents upon each of the two states Sikyôn and Ægina, for
having lent ships to the Spartan king Kleomenes, wherewith he invaded
the Argeian territory. The Æginetans set the claim at defiance,
but the Sikyonians acknowledged its justice, and only demurred
to its amount, professing themselves ready to pay 100 talents.<a
id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>
There can be no doubt that, at this later period, the ascendency
of Argos over the members of her primitive confederacy had become
practically inoperative; but the tenor of the cases mentioned shows
that her claims were revivals of bygone privileges, which had once
been effective and valuable.</p>

<p>How valuable the privileges of Argos were, before the great rise
of the Spartan power,—how important an ascendency they conferred, in
the hands of an energetic man, and how easily they admitted of being
used in furtherance of ambitious views, is shown by the remarkable
case of Pheidôn, the Temenid. The few facts which we learn respecting
this prince exhibit to us, for the first time, something like a
real position of parties in the Peloponnesus, wherein the actual
conflict of living historical men and cities, comes out in tolerable
distinctness.</p>

<p>Pheidôn was designated by Ephorus as the tenth, and by
Theopompus as the sixth, in lineal descent from Têmenus. Respecting
the date of his existence, opinions the most discrepant and
irreconcilable have been delivered; but there seems good reason
for referring him to the period a little before and a little after
the 8th Olympiad,—between 770 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> and 730<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[p. 315]</span> <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a
id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
Of the preceding kings of Argos we hear little: one of them,
Eratus, is said to have expelled the Dryopian inhabitants of Asinê
from their town on the Argolic peninsula, in consequence of their
having coöperated with the Spartan king, Nikander, when he invaded
the Argeian territory, seemingly during the generation preceding
Pheidôn; there is another, Damokratidas, whose date cannot be
positively determined, but he appears rather as subsequent than
as anterior to Pheidôn.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522"
class="fnanchor">[522]</a> We are informed, however, that these
anterior kings, even beginning with Medôn, the grandson of Têmenus,
had been forced to submit to great abridgment of their power and
privileges, and that a form of government substantially popular,
though nominally regal, had been established.<a id="FNanchor_523"
href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Pheidôn, breaking
through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[p. 316]</span> the
limits imposed, made himself despot of Argos. He then re-established
the power of Argos over all the cities of her confederacy, which
had before been so nearly dissolved as to leave all the members
practically independent.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524"
class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Next, he is said to have acquired dominion
over Corinth, and to have endeavored to assure it, by treacherously
entrapping a thousand of her warlike citizens; but his artifice was
divulged and frustrated by Abrôn, one of his confidential friends.<a
id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
He is farther reported to have aimed at extending his sway over
the greater part of Peloponnesus,—laying claim, as the descendant
of Hêraklês, through the eldest son of Hyllus, to all the cities
which that restless and irresistible hero had ever taken.<a
id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
According to Grecian ideas, this legendary title was always seriously
construed, and often admitted as conclusive; though of course, where
there were strong opposing interests, reasons would be found to
elude it. Pheidôn would have the same ground of right as that which,
two hundred and fifty years afterwards, determined the Herakleid
Dôrieus, brother of Kleomenês king of Sparta, to acquire for himself
the territory near Mount Eryx in Sicily, because his progenitor,<a
id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
Hêraklês, had conquered it before him. So numerous, however, were
the legends respecting the conquests of Hêraklês, that the claim of
Pheidôn must have covered the greater part of Peloponnesus, except
Sparta and the plain of Messêne, which were already in the hands of
Herakleids.</p>

<p>Nor was the ambition of Pheidôn satisfied even with these large
pretensions. He farther claimed the right of presiding at the
celebration of those religious games, or Agônes, which had<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[p. 317]</span> been instituted by
Hêraklês,—and among these was numbered the Olympic Agôn, then,
however, enjoying but a slender fraction of the lustre which
afterwards came to attach to it. The presidency of any of the more
celebrated festivals current throughout Greece, was a privilege
immensely prized. It was at once dignified and lucrative, and the
course of our history will present more than one example in which
blood was shed to determine what state should enjoy it. Pheidôn
marched to Olympia, at the epoch of the 8th recorded Olympiad, or
747 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; on the occasion of which event we are made
acquainted with the real state of parties in the peninsula.</p>

<p>The plain of Olympia,—now ennobled only by immortal recollections,
but once crowded with all the decorations of religion and art,
and forming for many centuries the brightest centre of attraction
known in the ancient world,—was situated on the river Alpheius, in
the territory called the Pisatid, hard by the borders of Arcadia.
At what time its agonistic festival, recurring every fifth year,
at the first full moon after the summer solstice, first began or
first acquired its character of special sanctity, we have no means
of determining. As with so many of the native waters of Greece,—we
follow the stream upward to a certain point, but the fountain-head,
and the earlier flow of history, is buried under mountains of
unsearchable legend. The first celebration of the Olympic contests
was ascribed by Grecian legendary faith to Hêraklês,—and the site
of the place, in the middle of the Pisatid, with its eight small
townships, is quite sufficient to prove that the inhabitants of
that little territory were warranted in describing themselves as
the original administrators of the ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_528"
href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> But this state of
things seems to have been altered by the Ætolian settlement in
Elis, which is represented as having been conducted by Oxylus and
identified with the Return of the Herakleids. The Ætolo-Eleians,
bordering upon the Pisatid to the north, employed their superior
power in subduing their weaker neighbors,<a id="FNanchor_529"
href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> who thus lost
their autonomy and became annexed to the territory of Elis. It
was the general rule throughout Greece, that a victorious state
undertook to perform<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530"
class="fnanchor">[530]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[p.
318]</span> the current services of the conquered people towards
the gods,—such services being conceived as attaching to the soil:
hence, the celebration of the Olympic games became numbered among
the incumbences of Elis, just in the same way as the worship of the
Eleusinian Dêmêtêr, when Eleusis lost its autonomy, was included
among the religious obligations of Athens. The Pisatans, however,
never willingly acquiesced in this absorption of what had once been
their separate privilege; they long maintained their conviction,
that the celebration of the games was their right, and strove on
several occasions to regain it. On those occasions, the earliest,
so far as we hear, was connected with the intervention of Pheidôn.
It was at their invitation that the king of Argos went to Olympia,
and celebrated the games himself, in conjunction with the Pisatans,
as the lineal successor of Hêraklês; while the Eleians, being thus
forcibly dispossessed, refused to include the 8th Olympiad in their
register of the victorious runners. But their humiliation did
not last long, for the Spartans took their part, and the contest
ended in the defeat of Pheidôn. In the next Olympiad, the Eleian
management and the regular enrolment appear as before, and the
Spartans are even said to have confirmed Elis in her possession both
of Pisatis and Triphylia.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531"
class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, these scanty particulars are all which we learn
respecting the armed conflict at the 8th Olympiad, in which the
religious and the political grounds of quarrel are so intimately
blended,—as we shall find to be often the case in Grecian history.
But there is one act of Pheidôn yet more memorable, of which also
nothing beyond a meagre notice has come down to us. He first coined
both copper and silver money in Ægina, and first established a scale
of weights and measures,<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532"
class="fnanchor">[532]</a> which, through his influence, became
adopted throughout Peloponnesus, and acquired, ultimately, footing
both in all the Dorian states, and in Bœotia, Thessaly, northern
Hellas generally, and Macedonia,—under the name of the Æginæan Scale.
There arose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[p. 319]</span>
subsequently another rival scale in Greece, called the Euboic,
differing considerably from the Æginæan. We do not know at what
time it was introduced, but it was employed both at Athens and in
the Ionic cities generally, as well as in Eubœa,—being modified at
Athens, so far as money was concerned, by Solon’s debasement of the
coinage.</p>

<p>The copious and valuable information contained in M.
Boeckh’s recent publication on Metrology, has thrown new light
upon these monetary and statical scales.<a id="FNanchor_533"
href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> He has shown that
both the Æginæan and the Euboic scales—the former standing to the
latter in the proportion of 6 : 5—had contemporaneous currency
in different parts of the Persian empire; the divisions and
denominations of the scale being the same in both, 100 drachmæ to
a mina, and 60 minæ to a talent. The Babylonian talent, mina, and
drachma are identical with the Æginæan: the word mina is of Asiatic
origin; and it has now been rendered highly probable, that the scale
circulated by Pheidôn was borrowed immediately from the Phœnicians,
and by them originally from the Babylonians. The Babylonian, Hebraic,
Phœnician, Egyptian,<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534"
class="fnanchor">[534]</a> and Grecian scales of weight (which were
subsequently followed wherever coined money was introduced) are found
to be so nearly conformable, as to warrant a belief that they are
all deduced from one common origin; and that origin the Chaldæan
priesthood of Babylon. It is to Pheidôn, and to his position as chief
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[p. 320]</span> Argeian
confederacy, that the Greeks owe the first introduction of the
Babylonian scale of weight, and the first employment of coined and
stamped money.</p>

<p>If we maturely weigh the few, but striking acts of Pheidôn which
have been preserved to us, and which there is no reason to discredit,
we shall find ourselves introduced to an early historical state
of Peloponnesus very different from that to which another century
will bring us. That Argos, with the federative cities attached to
her, was at this early time decidedly the commanding power in that
peninsula, is sufficiently shown by the establishment and reception
of the Pheidonian weights, measures, and monetary system,—while the
other incidents mentioned completely harmonize with the same idea.
Against the oppressions of Elis, the Pisatans invoked Pheidon,—partly
as exercising a primacy in Peloponnesus, just as the inhabitants
of Lepreum in Triphylia,<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535"
class="fnanchor">[535]</a> three centuries afterwards, called
in the aid of Sparta for the same object, at a time when Sparta
possessed the headship,—and partly as the lineal representative of
Hêraklês, who had founded those games from the management of which
they had been unjustly extruded. On the other hand, Sparta appears
as a second-rate power. The Æginæan scale of weight and measure was
adopted there as elsewhere,<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536"
class="fnanchor">[536]</a>—the Messenian Dorians were still equal
and independent,—and we find Sparta interfering to assist Elis
by virtue of an obligation growing (so the legend represents it)
out of the common Ætolo-Dorian emigration; not at all from any
acknowledged primacy, such as we shall see her enjoying hereafter.
The first coinage of copper and silver money is a capital event in
Grecian history, and must be held to imply considerable commerce as
well as those extensive views which belong only to a conspicuous
and leading position. The ambition of Pheidôn to resume all the
acquisitions made by his ancestor Hêraklês, suggests the same large
estimate of his actual power. He is characterized as a despot, and
even as the most insolent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[p.
321]</span> of all despots:<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537"
class="fnanchor">[537]</a> how far he deserved such a reputation,
we have no means of judging. We may remark, however, that he lived
before the age of despots or tyrants, properly so called, and before
the Herakleid lineage had yet lost its primary, half-political,
half-religious character. Moreover, the later historians have
invested his actions with a color of exorbitant aggression, by
applying them to a state of things which belonged to their time
and not to his. Thus Ephorus represents him as having deprived the
Lacedæmonians of the headship of Peloponnesus, which they never
possessed until long after him,—and also as setting at naught the
sworn inviolability of the territory of the Eleians, enjoyed by the
latter as celebrators of the Olympic games; whereas the Agonothesia,
or right of superintendence claimed by Elis, had not at that time
acquired the sanction of prescription,—while the conquest of Pisa by
the Eleians themselves had proved that this sacred function did not
protect the territory of a weaker people.</p>

<p>How Pheidôn fell, and how the Argeians lost that supremacy which
they once evidently possessed, we have no positive details to inform
us: with respect to the latter point, however, we can discern a
sufficient explanation. The Argeians stood predominant as an entire
and unanimous confederacy, which required a vigorous and able hand
to render its internal organization effective or its ascendency
respected without. No such leader afterwards appeared at Argos, the
whole history of which city is destitute of eminent individuals:
her line of kings continued at least down to the Persian war,<a
id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
but seemingly with only titular functions, for the government had
long been decidedly popular. The statements, which represent the
government as popular anterior to the time of Pheidôn, appear
unworthy of trust. That prince is rather to be taken as wielding the
old, undiminished prerogatives of the Herakleid kings, but wielding
them with unusual effect,—enforcing relaxed privileges, and appealing
to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p. 322]</span> old heroic
sentiment in reference to Hêraklês, rather than revolutionizing the
existing relations either of Argos or of Peloponnesus. It was in fact
the great and steady growth of Sparta, for three centuries after the
Lykurgean institutions, which operated as a cause of subversion to
the previous order of command and obedience in Greece.</p>

<p>The assertion made by Herodotus,—that, in earlier times, the
whole eastern coast of Laconia as far as Cape Malea, including
the island of Kythêra and several other islands, had belonged to
Argos,—is referred by O. Müller to about the 50th Olympiad, or
580 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Perhaps it had ceased to be true at that
period; but that it was true in the age of Pheidôn, there seem good
grounds for believing. What is probably meant is, that the Dorian
towns on this coast, Prasiæ, Zarêx, Epidaurus Limêra, and Bœæ, were
once autonomous, and members of the Argeian confederacy,—a fact
highly probable, on independent evidence, with respect to Epidaurus
Limêra, inasmuch as that town was a settlement from Epidaurus in
the Argolic peninsula: and Bœæ too had its own œkist and eponymus,
the Herakleid Bœus,<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539"
class="fnanchor">[539]</a> noway connected with Sparta,—perhaps
derived from the same source as the name of the town Bœon in Doris.
The Argeian confederated towns would thus comprehend the whole coast
of the Argolic and Saronic gulfs, from Kythêra as far as Ægina,
besides other islands which we do not know: Ægina had received a
colony of Dorians from Argos and Epidaurus, upon which latter town it
continued for some time in a state of dependence.<a id="FNanchor_540"
href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> It will at once
be seen that this extent of coast implies a considerable degree
of commerce and maritime activity. We have besides to consider
the range of Doric colonies in the southern islands of the Ægean
and in the south-western corner of Asia Minor,—Krête, Kôs, Rhodes
(with its three distinct cities), Halikarnassus, Knidus, Myndus,
Nisyrus, Symê, Karpathus, Kalydna, etc. Of the Doric establishments
here named, several are connected (as has been before stated) with
the great emigration of the Têmenid Althæmenês from Argos: but
what we particularly observe is, that they are often referred as
colonies promiscuously to Argos, Trœzên,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_323">[p. 323]</span> Epidaurus<a id="FNanchor_541"
href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>—more frequently
however, as it seems, to Argos. All these settlements are doubtless
older than Pheidôn, and we may conceive them as proceeding conjointly
from the allied Dorian towns in the Argolic peninsula, at a time when
they were more in the habit of united action than they afterwards
became: a captain of emigrants selected from the line of Hêraklês
and Têmenus was suitable to the feelings of all of them. We may
thus look back to a period, at the very beginning of the Olympiads,
when the maritime Dorians on the east of Peloponnesus maintained a
considerable intercourse and commerce, not only among themselves, but
also with their settlements on the Asiatic coast and islands. That
the Argolic peninsula formed an early centre for maritime rendezvous,
we may farther infer from the very ancient Amphiktyony of the
seven cities (Hermionê, Epidaurus, Ægina, Athens, Prasiæ, Nauplia,
and the Minyeian Orchomenus), on the holy island of Kalauria, off
the harbor of Trœzên.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542"
class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>The view here given of the early ascendency of Argos, as the
head of the Peloponnesian Dorians and the metropolis of the Asiatic
Dorians, enables us to understand the capital innovation of
Pheidôn,—the first coinage, and the first determinate scale of weight
and measure, known in Greece. Of the value of such improvements, in
the history of Grecian civilization, it is superfluous to speak,
especially when we recollect that the Hellenic states, having no
political unity, were only held together by the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span> aggregate of spontaneous uniformities,
in language, religion, sympathies, recreations, and general habits.
We see both how Pheidôn came to contract the wish, and how he
acquired the power, to introduce throughout so much of the Grecian
world an uniform scale; we also see that the Asiatic Dorians form
the link between him and Phœnicia, from whence the scale was
derived, just as the Euboic scale came, in all probability, through
the Ionic cities in Asia, from Lydia. It is asserted by Ephorus,
and admitted even by the ablest modern critics, that Pheidôn first
coined money “in Ægina:”<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543"
class="fnanchor">[543]</a> other authors (erroneously believing that
his scale was the Euboic scale) alleged that his coinage had been
carried on “in a place of Argos called Eubœa.”<a id="FNanchor_544"
href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> Now both these
statements appear highly improbable, and both are traceable to the
same mistake,—of supposing that the title, by which the scale had
come to be commonly known, must necessarily be derived from the
place in which the coinage had been struck. There is every reason
to conclude, that what Pheidôn did was done in Argos, and nowhere
else: his coinage and scale were the earliest known in Greece,
and seem to have been known by his own name, “the Pheidonian
measures,” under which designation they were described by Aristotle,
in his account of the constitution of Argos.<a id="FNanchor_545"
href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> They probably did
not come to bear the specific epithet of <i>Æginæan</i> until there was
another scale in vogue, the <i>Euboic</i>, from which to distinguish them;
and both the epithets were probably derived, not from the place where
the scale first originated, but from the people whose commercial
activity tended to make them most generally known,—in the one case,
the Æginetans; in the other case, the inhabitants of Chalkis and
Eretria. I think, therefore, that we are to look upon the Pheidonian
measures as emanating from Argos, and as having<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_325">[p. 325]</span> no greater connection, originally, with
Ægina, than with any other city dependent upon Argos.</p>

<p>There is, moreover, another point which deserves notice. What
was known by the name of the Æginæan scale, as contrasted with
and standing in a definite ratio (6 : 5) with the Euboic scale,
related only to weight and money, so far as our knowledge extends:<a
id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
we have no evidence to show that the same ratio extended either
to measures of length or measures of capacity. But there seems
ground for believing that the Pheidonian regulations, taken in
their full comprehension, embraced measures of capacity as well
as weights: Pheidôn, at the same time when he determined the
talent, mina, and drachm, seems also to have fixed the dry and
liquid measures,—the medimnus and metrêtês, with their parts and
multiples: and there existed<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547"
class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Pheidonian measures of capacity, though
not of length, so far as we know. The Æginæan scale may thus have
comprised only a portion of what was established by Pheidôn, namely,
that which related to weight and money.</p>

    ÆTOLO-DORIAN EMIGRATION INTO PELOPONNESUS.—ELIS,
    LACONIA, AND MESSENIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">It has</span> already been
stated that the territory properly called Elis, apart from the
enlargement which it acquired by conquest, included the westernmost
land in Peloponnesus, south of Achaia, and west of Mount Pholoê
and Olenus in Arcadia,—but not extending so far southward as the
river Alpheius, the course of which lay along the southern portion
of Pisatis and on the borders of Triphylia. This territory, which
appears in the Odyssey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[p.
326]</span> as “the divine Elis, where the Epeians hold sway,”<a
id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>
is in the historical times occupied by a population of Ætolian
origin. The connection of race between the historical Eleians and the
historical Ætolians was recognized by both parties, nor is there any
ground for disputing it.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549"
class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p>That Ætolian invaders, or emigrants, into Elis, would cross from
Naupaktus, or some neighboring point in the Corinthian gulf, is in
the natural course of things,—and such is the course which Oxylus,
the conductor of the invasion, is represented by the Herakleid legend
as taking. That legend (as has been already recounted) introduces
Oxylus as the guide of the three Herakleid brothers,—Têmenus,
Kresphontês, and Aristodêmus,—and as stipulating with them that, in
the new distribution about to take place of Peloponnesus, he shall
be allowed to possess the Eleian territory, coupled with many holy
privileges as to the celebration of the Olympic games.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter, I have endeavored to show that the
settlements of the Dorians in and near the Argolic peninsula, so
far as the probabilities of the case enable us to judge, were not
accomplished by any inroad in this direction. But the localities
occupied by the Dorians of Sparta, and by the Dorians of Stenyklêrus,
in the territory called Messênê, lead us to a different conclusion.
The easiest and most natural road through which emigrants could
reach either of these two spots, is through the Eleian and the
Pisatid country. Colonel Leake observes,<a id="FNanchor_550"
href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> that the direct road
from the Eleian territory to Sparta, ascending the valley of the
Alpheius, near Olympia, to the sources of its branch, the Theius,
and from thence descending the Eurotas, affords the only easy march
towards that very inaccessible city: and both ancients and moderns
have remarked the vicinity of the source of the Alpheius to that of
the Eurotas. The situation of Stenyklêrus and Andania, the original
settlements of the Messenian Dorians, adjoining closely the Arcadian
Parrhasii, is only at a short distance from the course of the
Alpheius; being thus reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[p.
327]</span> most easily by the same route. Dismissing the idea of
a great collective Dorian armament, powerful enough to grasp at
once the entire peninsula,—we may conceive two moderate detachments
of hardy mountaineers, from the cold regions in and near Doris,
attaching themselves to the Ætolians, their neighbors, who were
proceeding to the invasion of Elis. After having aided the Ætolians,
both to occupy Elis and to subdue the Pisatid, these Dorians advanced
up the valley of the Alpheius in quest of settlements for themselves.
One of these bodies ripens into the stately, stubborn, and victorious
Spartans; the other, into the short-lived, trampled, and struggling
Messenians.</p>

<p>Amidst the darkness which overclouds these original settlements,
we seem to discern something like special causes to determine both
of them. With respect to the Spartan Dorians, we are told that
a person named Philonomus betrayed Sparta to them, persuading
the sovereign in possession to retire with his people into the
habitations of the Ionians, in the north of the peninsula,—and that
he received as a recompense for this acceptable service Amyklæ, with
the district around it. It is farther stated,—and this important
fact there seems no reason to doubt,—that Amyklæ,—though only
twenty stadia or two miles and a half distant from Sparta, retained
both its independence and its Achæan inhabitants, long after the
Dorian emigrants had acquired possession of the latter place, and
was only taken by them under the reign of Têleklus, one generation
before the first Olympiad.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551"
class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Without presuming to fill up by conjecture
incurable gaps in the statements of our authorities, we may from
hence reasonably presume that the Dorians were induced to invade,
and enabled to acquire, Sparta, by the invitation and assistance of
a party in the interior of the country. Again, with respect to the
Messenian Dorians, a different, but not less effectual temptation
was presented by the alliance of the Arcadians, in the south-western
portion of that central region of Peloponnesus. Kresphontês,
the Herakleid leader, it is said, espoused the daughter<a
id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>
of the Arcadian king, Kypselus, which procured for him the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[p. 328]</span> support of a powerful
section of Arcadia. His settlement at Stenyklêrus was a considerable
distance from the sea, at the north-east corner of Messenia,<a
id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
close to the Arcadian frontier; and it will be seen hereafter that
this Arcadian alliance is a constant and material element in the
disputes of the Messenian Dorians with Sparta.</p>

<p>We may thus trace a reasonable sequence of events, showing how
two bodies of Dorians, having first assisted the Ætolo-Eleians to
conquer the Pisatid, and thus finding themselves on the banks of
the Alpheius, followed the upward course of that river, the one to
settle at Sparta, the other at Stenyklêrus. The historian Ephorus,
from whom our scanty fragments of information respecting these early
settlements are derived,—it is important to note that he lived in the
age immediately succeeding the first foundation of Messênê as a city,
the restitution of the long-exiled Messenians, and the amputation
of the fertile western half of Laconia, for their benefit, by
Epameinondas,—imparts to these proceedings an immediate decisiveness
of effect which does not properly belong to them: as if the Spartans
had become at once possessed of all Laconia, and the Messenians of
all Messenia: Pausanias, too, speaks as if the Arcadians collectively
had assisted and allied themselves with Kresphontês. This is the
general spirit which pervades his account, though the particular
facts in so far as we find any such, do not always harmonize with
it. Now we are ignorant of the preëxisting divisions of the country,
either east or west of Mount Taygetus, at the time when the Dorians
invaded it. But to treat the one and the other as integral kingdoms,
handed over at once to two Dorian leaders, is an illusion borrowed
from the old legend, from the historicizing fancies of Ephorus, and
from the fact that, in the well-known times, this whole territory
came to be really united under the Spartan power.</p>

<p>At what date the Dorian settlements at Sparta and Stenyklêrus
were effected, we have no means of determining. Yet, that
there existed between them in the earliest times a degree
of fraternity which did not prevail between Lacedæmon and
Argos,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[p. 329]</span> we
may fairly presume from the common temple, with joint religious
sacrifices, of Artemis Limnatis, or Artemis on the Marsh, erected
on the confines of Messenia and Laconia.<a id="FNanchor_554"
href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Our first view of
the two, at all approaching to distinctness, seems to date from a
period about half a century earlier than the first Olympiad (776
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),—about the reign of king Têleklus of the
Eurystheneid or Agid line, and the introduction of the Lykurgean
discipline. Têleklus stands in the list as the eighth king dating
from Eurysthenes. But how many of the seven kings before him are
to be considered as real persons,—or how much, out of the brief
warlike expeditions ascribed to them, is to be treated as authentic
history,—I pretend not to define.</p>

<p>The earliest determinable event in the <i>internal</i> history
of Sparta is the introduction of the Lykurgean discipline; the
earliest <i>external</i> events are the conquest of Amyklæ, Pharis, and
Geronthræ, effected by king Têleklus, and the first quarrel with
the Messenians, in which that prince was slain. When we come to see
how deplorably great was the confusion and ignorance which reigned
with reference to a matter so preëminently important as Lykurgus
and his legislation, we shall not be inclined to think that facts
much less important, and belonging to an earlier epoch, can have
been handed down upon any good authority. And in like manner, when
we learn that Amyklæ, Pharis, and Geronthræ (all south of Sparta,
and the first only two and a half miles distant from that city)
were independent of the Spartans until the reign of Têleklus, we
shall require some decisive testimony before we can believe that a
community so small, and so hemmed in as Sparta must then have been,
had in earlier times undertaken expeditions against Helos on the
sea-coast, against Kleitor on the extreme northern side of Arcadia,
against the Kynurians, or against the Argeians. If Helos and Kynuria
were conquered by these early kings, it appears that they had to be
conquered a second time by kings succeeding Têleklus. It would be
more natural that we should hear when and how they conquered the
places nearer to them,—Sellasia, or Belemina, the valley of the
Œnus, or the upper valley of the Eurotas. But these seem to be<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span> assumed as matters
of course; the proceedings ascribed to the early Spartan kings are
such only as might beseem the palmy days when Sparta was undisputed
mistress of all Laconia.</p>

<p>The succession of Messenian kings, beginning with Kresphontês,
the Herakleid brother, and continuing from father to son,—Æpytus,
Glaukus, Isthnius, Dotadas, Subotas, Phintas, the last being
contemporary with Têleklus,—is still less marked by incident than
that of the early Spartan kings. It is said that the reign of
Kresphontês was troubled, and himself ultimately slain by mutinies
among his subjects: Æpytus, then a youth, having escaped into
Arcadia, was afterwards restored to the throne by the Arcadians,
Spartans, and Argeians.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555"
class="fnanchor">[555]</a> From Æpytus, the Messenian line of
kings are stated to have been denominated Æpytids in preference to
Herakleids,—which affords another proof of their intimate connection
with the Arcadians, since Æpytus was a very ancient name in
Arcadian heroic antiquity.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556"
class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>There is considerable resemblance between the alleged behavior of
Kresphontês on first settling at Stenyklêrus, and that of Eurysthenês
and Proklês at Sparta,—so far as we gather from statements alike
meagre and uncertified, resting on the authority of Ephorus. Both
are said to have tried to place the preëxisting inhabitants of
the country on a level with their own Dorian bands; both provoked
discontents and incurred obloquy, with their contemporaries as
well as with posterity, by the attempt; nor did either permanently
succeed. Kresphontês was forced to concentrate all his Dorians
in Stenyklêrus, while after all, the discontents ended in his
violent death. And Agis, the son of Eurysthenês, is said to have
reversed all the liberal tentatives of his father, so as to bring
the whole of Laconia into subjection and dependence on the Dorians
at Sparta, with the single exception of Amyklæ. So odious to the
Spartan Dorians was the conduct of Eurysthenês, that they refused to
acknowledge him as their œkist, and conferred that honor upon Agis;
the two lines of kings being called Agiads<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_331">[p. 331]</span> and Eurypontids, instead of
Eurystheneids and Prokleids.<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557"
class="fnanchor">[557]</a> We see in these statements the same tone
of mind as that which pervades the Panathenaic oration of Isokratês,
the master of Ephorus,—the facts of an unknown period, so colored as
to suit an <i>idéal</i> of haughty Dorian exclusiveness.</p>

<p>Again, as Eurysthenês and Proklês appear, in the picture of
Ephorus, to carry their authority at once over the whole of Laconia,
so too does Kresphontês over the whole of Messenia,—over the entire
south-western region of Peloponnesus, westward of Mount Taygetus
and Cape Tænarus, and southward of the river Neda. He sends an
envoy to Pylus and Rhium, the western and southern portions of
the south-western promontory of Peloponnesus, treating the entire
territory as if it were one sovereignty, and inviting the inhabitants
to submit under equal laws.<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558"
class="fnanchor">[558]</a> But it has already been observed, that
this supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span>
oneness and indivisibility is not less uncertified in regard to
Messenia than in regard to Laconia. How large a proportion of the
former territory these kings of Stenyklêrus may have ruled, we
have no means of determining, but there were certainly portions
of it which they did not rule,—not merely during the reign of
Têleklus at Sparta, but still later, during the first Messenian
war. For not only are we informed that Têleklus established three
townships, Poiêessa, Echeiæ,<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559"
class="fnanchor">[559]</a> and Tragium, near the Messenian gulf,
and on the course of the river Nedon, but we read also a farther
matter of evidence in the roll of Olympic victors. Every competitor
for the prize at one of these great festivals was always entered as
member of some autonomous Hellenic community, which constituted his
title to approach the lists; if successful, he was proclaimed with
the name of the community to which he belonged. Now during the first
ten Olympiads, seven winners are proclaimed as Messenians; in the
11th Olympiad, we find the name of Oxythemis Korônæus,—Oxythemis,
not of Korôneia in Bœotia, but of Korônê in the western bend of
the Messenian gulf,<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560"
class="fnanchor">[560]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[p.
333]</span> some miles on the right bank of the Pamisus, and a
considerable distance to the north of the modern Coron. Now if Korônê
had then been comprehended in Messenia, Oxythemis would have been
proclaimed as a Messenian, like the seven winners who preceded him;
and the fact of his being proclaimed as a Korônæan, proves that
Korônê was then an independent community, not under the dominion
of the Dorians of Stenyklêrus. It seems clear, therefore, that the
latter did not reign over the whole territory commonly known as
Messenia, though we are unable to assign the proportion of it which
they actually possessed.</p>

<p>The Olympic festival, in its origin doubtless a privilege of
the neighboring Pisatans, seems to have derived its great and
gradually expanding importance from the Ætolo-Eleian settlement in
Peloponnesus, combined with the Dorians of Laconia and Messenia.
Lykurgus of Sparta, and Iphitus of Elis, are alleged to have joined
their efforts for the purpose of establishing both the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span> sanctity of the Olympic
truce and the inviolability of the Eleian territory. Hence, though
this tale is not to be construed as matter of fact, we may see that
the Lacedæmonians regarded the Olympic games as a portion of their
own antiquities. Moreover, it is certain, both that the dignity
of the festival increased simultaneously with their ascendency,<a
id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
and that their peculiar fashions were very early introduced into the
practice of the Olympic competitors. Probably, the three bands of
coöperating invaders, Ætolians and Spartan and Messenian Dorians,
may have adopted this festival as a periodical renovation of mutual
union and fraternity; from which cause the games became an attractive
centre for the western portion of Peloponnesus, before they were
much frequented by people from the eastern, or still more from
extra-Peloponnesian Hellas. For it cannot be altogether accidental,
when we read the names of the first twelve proclaimed Olympic victors
(occupying nearly half a century from 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
downwards), to find that seven of them are Messenians, three Eleians,
one from Dymê, in Achaia, and one from Korônê; while after the 12th
Olympiad, Corinthians and Megarians and Epidaurians begin to occur;
later still, extra-Peloponnesian victors. We may reasonably infer
from hence that the Olympic ceremonies were at this early period
chiefly frequented by visitors and competitors from the western
regions of Peloponnesus, and that the affluence to them, from the
more distant parts of the Hellenic world, did not become considerable
until the first Messenian war had closed.</p>

<p>Having thus set forth the conjectures, to which our very scanty
knowledge points, respecting the first establishment of the Ætolian
and Dorian settlements in Elis, Laconia, and Messenia, connected
as they are with the steadily increasing dignity and frequentation
of the Olympic festival, I proceed, in the next chapter, to that
memorable circumstance which both determined the character, and
brought about the political ascendency, of the Spartans separately: I
mean, the laws and discipline of Lykurgus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[p. 335]</span>Of the
preëxisting inhabitants of Laconia and Messenia, whom we are
accustomed to call Achæans and Pylians, so little is known, that we
cannot at all measure the difference between them and their Dorian
invaders, either in dialect, in habits, or in intelligence. There
appear no traces of any difference of dialect among the various parts
of the population of Laconia: the Messenian allies of Athens, in the
Peloponnesian war, speak the same dialect as the Helots, and the
same also as the Ambrakiotic colonists from Corinth: all Doric.<a
id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
Nor are we to suppose that the Doric dialect was at all peculiar
to the people called Dorians. As far as can be made out by the
evidence of Inscriptions, it seems to have been the dialect of the
Phokians, Delphians, Lokrians, Ætolians, and Achæans of Phthiôtis:
with respect to the latter, the Inscriptions of Thaumaki, in Achæa
Phthiôtis, afford a proof the more curious and the more cogent of
native dialect, because the Phthiôts were both immediate neighbors
and subjects of the Thessalians, who spoke a variety of the Æolic.
So, too, within Peloponnesus, we find evidences of Doric dialect
among the Achæans in the north of Peloponnesus,—the Dryopic
inhabitants of Hermionê,<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563"
class="fnanchor">[563]</a>—and the Eleuthero-Lacones, or Laconian
townships (compounded of Periœki and Helots), emancipated by the
Romans in the second century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Concerning the
speech of that population whom the invading Dorians found in
Laconia, we have no means of judging: the presumption would rather
be that it did not differ materially from the Doric. Thucydidês
designates the Corinthians, whom the invading Dorians attacked from
the hill Solygeius, as being Æolians, and Strabo speaks both of
the Achæans as an Æolic nation, and of the Æolic dialect as having
been originally preponderant in Peloponnesus.<a id="FNanchor_564"
href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> But we do not readily
see what means of information either of these authors possessed
respecting the speech of a time which must have been four centuries
anterior even to Thucydidês.</p>

<p>Of that which is called the Æolic dialect there are three<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[p. 336]</span> marked and
distinguishable varieties,—the Lesbian, the Thessalian, and the
Bœotian; the Thessalian forming a mean term between the other two.
Ahrens has shown that the ancient grammatical critics are accustomed
to affirm peculiarities, as belonging to the Æolic dialect generally,
which in truth belong only to the Lesbian variety of it, or to
the poems of Alkæus and Sappho, which these critics attentively
studied. Lesbian Æolic, Thessalian Æolic, and Bœotian Æolic, are all
different: and if, abstracting from these differences, we confine
our attention to that which is common to all three, we shall find
little to distinguish this abstract Æolic from the abstract Doric, or
that which is common to the many varieties of the Doric dialect.<a
id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
These two are sisters, presenting, both of them, more or less the
Latin side of the Greek language, while the relationship of either
of them to the Attic and Ionic is more distant. Now it seems that,
putting aside Attica, the speech of all Greece,<a id="FNanchor_566"
href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> from Perrhæbia
and Mount Olympus to Cape Malea and Cape Akritas, consisted of
different varieties, either of the Doric or of the Æolic dialect;
this being true (as far as we are able to judge) not less of the
aboriginal Arcadians than of the rest. The Laconian dialect<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[p. 337]</span> contained more
specialties of its own, and approached nearer to the Æolic and to
the Eleian, than any other variety of the Dorian: it stands at the
extreme of what has been classified as the strict Dorian,—that is,
the farthest removed from Ionic and Attic. The Kretan towns manifest
also a strict Dorism; as well as the Lacedæmonian colony of Tarentum,
and, seemingly, most of the Italiotic Greeks, though some of them
are called Achæan colonies. Most of the other varieties of the Doric
dialect (Phokian, Lokrian, Delphian, Achæan of Phthiôtis) exhibit a
form departing less widely from the Ionic and Attic: Argos, and the
towns in the Argolic peninsula, seem to form a stepping-stone between
the two.</p>

<p>These positions represent the little which can be known respecting
those varieties of Grecian speech which are not known to us by
written works. The little presumption which can be raised upon them
favors the belief that the Dorian invaders of Laconia and Messenia
found there a dialect little different from that which they brought
with them,—a conclusion which it is the more necessary to state
distinctly, since the work of O. Müller has caused an exaggerated
estimate to be formed of the distinctive peculiarities whereby Dorism
was parted off from the rest of Hellas.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />
    LAWS AND DISCIPLINE OF LYKURGUS AT SPARTA.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">Plutarch</span> begins his
biography of Lykurgus with the following ominous words:—</p>

<p>“Concerning the lawgiver Lykurgus, we can assert absolutely
nothing which is not controverted: there are different stories in
respect to his birth, his travels, his death, and also his mode of
proceeding, political as well as legislative: least of all is the
time in which he lived agreed upon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[p. 338]</span>And this
exordium is but too well borne out by the unsatisfactory nature
of the accounts which we read, not only in Plutarch himself, but
in those other authors out of whom we are obliged to make up our
idea of the memorable Lykurgean system. If we examine the sources
from which Plutarch’s life of Lykurgus is deduced, it will appear
that—excepting the poets Alkman, Tyrtæus, and Simonidês, from whom
he has borrowed less than we could have wished—he has no authorities
older than Xenophon and Plato: Aristotle is cited several times,
and is unquestionably the best of his witnesses, but the greater
number of them belong to the century subsequent to that philosopher.
Neither Herodotus nor Ephorus are named, though the former furnishes
some brief, but interesting particulars,—and the latter also (as
far as we can judge from the fragments remaining) entered at large
into the proceedings of the Spartan lawgiver.<a id="FNanchor_567"
href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>Lykurgus is described by Herodotus as uncle and guardian
to king Labôtas, of the Eurystheneid or Agid line of Spartan
kings; and this would place him, according to the received
chronology, about 220 years before the first recorded Olympiad
(about <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 996).<a id="FNanchor_568"
href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> All the other
accounts, on the contrary, seem to represent him as a younger
brother, belonging to the other or Prokleid line of Spartan kings,
though they do not perfectly agree respecting his parentage. While
Simonidês stated him to be the son of Prytanis, Dieutychidas
described him as grandson of Prytanis, son of Eunomus, brother
of Polydektês, and uncle as well as guardian to Charilaus,—thus
making him eleventh in descent from Hêraklês.<a id="FNanchor_569"
href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> This latter
account was adopted by Aristotle, coinciding, according to the
received chronology, with the date of Iphitus the Eleian, and
the first celebration of the Olympic games by Lykurgus and
Iphitus conjointly,<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570"
class="fnanchor">[570]</a> which Aristotle<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span> accepted as a fact. Lykurgus,
on the hypothesis here mentioned, would stand about
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 880, a century before the recorded
Olympiads. Eratosthenês and Apollodorus placed him “not a few years
earlier than the first Olympiad.” If they meant hereby the epoch
commonly assigned as the Olympiad of Iphitus, their date would
coincide pretty nearly with that of Herodotus: if, on the other hand,
they meant the first recorded Olympiad (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
776), they would be found not much removed from the opinion of
Aristotle. An unequivocal proof of the inextricable confusion in
ancient times respecting the epoch of the great Spartan lawgiver is
indirectly afforded by Timæus, who supposed that there had existed
two persons named Lykurgus, and that the acts of both had been
ascribed to one. It is plain from hence that there was no certainty
attainable, even in the third century before the Christian era,
respecting the date or parentage of Lykurgus.</p>

<p>Thucydidês, without mentioning the name of Lykurgus, informs us
that it was “400 years and somewhat more” anterior to the close of
the Peloponnesian war,<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571"
class="fnanchor">[571]</a> when the Spartans emerged from their
previous state of desperate internal disorder, and entered
upon “their present polity.” We may fairly presume that<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[p. 340]</span> this alludes to
the Lykurgean discipline and constitution, which Thucydides must
thus have conceived as introduced about <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
830-820,—coinciding with something near the commencement of the reign
of king Têleklus. In so far as it is possible to form an opinion,
amidst evidence at once so scanty and so discordant, I incline to
adopt the opinion of Thucydidês as to the time at which the Lykurgean
constitution was introduced at Sparta. The state of “eunomy” and
good order which that constitution brought about,—combined with
the healing of great previous internal sedition, which had tended
much to enfeeble them,—is represented (and with great plausibility)
as the grand cause of the victorious career beginning with king
Têleklus, the conqueror of Amyklæ, Pharis, and Geronthræ. Therefore
it would seem, in the absence of better evidence, that a date,
connecting the fresh stimulus of the new discipline with the reign of
Têleklus, is more probable than any epoch either later or earlier.<a
id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p. 341]</span>O. Müller,<a
id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
after glancing at the strange and improbable circumstances handed
down to us respecting Lykurgus, observes, “that we have absolutely
no account of him as an individual person.” This remark is perfectly
just: but another remark, made by the same distinguished author,
respecting the Lykurgean system of laws, appears to me erroneous,—and
requires more especially to be noticed, inasmuch as the corollaries
deduced from it pervade a large portion of his valuable History of
the Dorians. He affirms that the laws of Sparta were considered
the true Doric institutions, and that their origin was identical
with that of the people: Sparta is, in his view, the full type of
Dorian principles, tendencies, and sentiments,—and is so treated
throughout his entire work.<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574"
class="fnanchor">[574]</a> But such an opinion is at once gratuitous
(for the passage of Pindar cited in support of it is scarcely of
any value) and contrary to the whole tenor of ancient evidence. The
institutions of Sparta were not Dorian, but peculiar to herself;<a
id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>
distinguishing her not less from Argos, Corinth, Megara, Epidaurus,
Sikyôn, Korkyra, or Knidus, than from Athens or Thebes. Krête was the
only other portion of Greece in which there prevailed institutions in
many respects analogous, yet still dissimilar in those two attributes
which form the real mark and pinch of Spartan legislation, namely,
the military discipline and the rigorous private training. There were
doubtless Dorians in Krête, but we have no proof that these peculiar
institutions belonged to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[p.
342]</span> them more than to the other inhabitants of the island.
That the Spartans had an original organization, and tendencies
common to them with the other Dorians, we may readily concede; but
the Lykurgean constitution impressed upon them a peculiar tendency,
which took them out of the general march, and rendered them the least
fit of all states to be cited as an example of the class-attributes
of Dorism. One of the essential causes, which made the Spartan
institutions work so impressively upon the Grecian mind, was their
perfect singularity, combined with the conspicuous ascendency of the
state in which they were manifested; while the Kretan communities,
even admitting their partial resemblance (which was chiefly in the
institution of the Syssitia, and was altogether more in form than in
spirit) to Sparta, were too insignificant to attract notice except
from speculative observers. It is therefore a mistake on the part of
O. Müller, to treat Sparta as the type and representative of Dorians
generally, and very many of the positions advanced in his History
of the Dorians require to be modified when this mistake is pointed
out.</p>

<p>The first capital fact to notice respecting the institutions
ascribed to Lykurgus, is the very early period at which they had
their commencement: it seems impossible to place this period later
than 825 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> We do not find, nor have we a right
to expect, trustworthy history in reference to events so early. If
we have one foot on historical ground, inasmuch as the institutions
themselves are real,—the other foot still floats in the unfaithful
region of mythe, when we strive to comprehend the generating causes:
the mist yet prevails which hinders us from distinguishing between
the god and the man. The light in which Lykurgus appeared, to an
intelligent Greek of the fifth century before the Christian era,
is so clearly, yet briefly depicted, in the following passage of
Herodotus, that I cannot do better than translate it:—</p>

<p>“In the very early times (Herodotus observes) the Spartans were
among themselves the most lawless of all Greeks, and unapproachable
by foreigners. Their transition to good legal order took place in
the following manner. When Lycurgus, a Spartan of consideration,
visited Delphi to consult the oracle, the instant that he entered the
sanctuary, the Pythian priestess exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“Thou art come, Lycurgus, to my fat shrine, beloved by Zeus,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[p. 343]</span> and by all the Olympic
gods. Is it as god or as man that I am to address thee in the spirit?
I hesitate,—and yet, Lycurgus, I incline more to call thee a god.”</p>

<p>So spake the Pythian priestess. “Moreover, in addition to these
words, some affirm that the Pythia revealed to him the order of
things now established among the Spartans. <i>But the Lacedæmonians
themselves</i> say, that Lycurgus, when guardian of his nephew Labôtas,
king of the Spartans, introduced these institutions out of Krete. No
sooner had he obtained this guardianship, than he changed all the
institutions into their present form, and took security against any
transgression of it. Next, he constituted the military divisions, the
Enômoties and the Triakads, as well as the Syssitia, or public mess:
he also, farther, appointed the ephors and the senate. By this means
the Spartans passed from bad to good order: to Lycurgus, after his
death, they built a temple, and they still worship him reverentially.
And as might naturally be expected in a productive soil, and with no
inconsiderable numbers of men, they immediately took a start forward,
and flourished so much that they could not be content to remain
tranquil within their own limits,” etc.</p>

<p>Such is our oldest statement (coming from Herodotus) respecting
Lykurgus, ascribing to him that entire order of things which the
writer witnessed at Sparta. Thucydidês also, though not mentioning
Lykurgus, agrees in stating that the system among the Lacedæmonians,
as he saw it, had been adopted by them four centuries previously,—had
rescued them from the most intolerable disorders, and had immediately
conducted them to prosperity and success.<a id="FNanchor_576"
href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Hellanikus, whose
writings a little preceded those of Herodotus, not only did not
(any more than Thucydidês) make mention of Lykurgus, but can
hardly be thought to have attached any importance to the name;
since he attributed the constitution of Sparta to the first kings,
Eurysthenes and Prokles.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577"
class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>But those later writers, from whom Plutarch chiefly compiled
his biography, profess to be far better informed on the subject of
Lykurgus, and enter more into detail. His father, we are told, was
assassinated during the preceding state of lawlessness; his elder
brother Polydektês died early, leaving a pregnant widow,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[p. 344]</span> who made to Lykurgus
propositions that he should marry her and become king. But Lykurgus,
repudiating the offer with indignation, awaited the birth of his
young nephew Charilaus, held up the child publicly in the agora, as
the future king of Sparta, and immediately relinquished the authority
which he had provisionally exercised. However, the widow and her
brother Leonidas raised slanderous accusations against him, of
designs menacing to the life of the infant king,—accusations which
he deemed it proper to obviate, by a temporary absence. Accordingly,
he left Sparta and went to Krête, where he studied the polity and
customs of the different cities; next, he visited Ionia and Egypt,
and (as some authors affirmed) Libya, Iberia, and even India. While
in Ionia, he is reported to have obtained from the descendants of
Kreophylus a copy of the Homeric poems, which had not up to that
time become known in Peloponnesus: there were not wanting authors,
indeed, who said that he had conversed with Homer himself.<a
id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the young king Charilaus grew up and assumed the
sceptre, as representing the Prokleid or Eurypontid family. But the
reins of government had become more relaxed, and the disorders worse
than ever, when Lykurgus returned. Finding that the two kings as well
as the people were weary of so disastrous a condition, he set himself
to the task of applying a corrective, and with this view consulted
the Delphian oracle; from which he received strong assurances
of the divine encouragement, together with one or more special
injunctions (the primitive Rhetræ of the constitution), which he
brought with him to Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579"
class="fnanchor">[579]</a> He then suddenly presented himself in
the agora, with thirty of the most distinguished Spartans, all
in arms, as his guards and partisans. King Charilaus, though at
first terrified, when informed of the designs of his uncle, stood
forward willingly to second them; while the bulk of the Spartans
respectfully submitted to the venerable Herakleid, who came as
reformer and missionary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p.
345]</span> from Delphi.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580"
class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Such were the steps by which Lykurgus
acquired his ascendency: we have now to see how he employed it.</p>

<p>His first proceeding, pursuant to the Rhetra or Compact brought
from Delphi, was to constitute the Spartan senate, consisting
of twenty-eight ancient men; making an aggregate of thirty in
conjunction with the two kings, who sat and voted in it. With this
were combined periodical assemblies of the Spartan people, in the
open air, between the river Knakiôn and the bridge Babyka. Yet
no discussion was permitted in these assemblies,—their functions
were limited to the simple acceptance or rejection of that which
had previously been determined in the senate.<a id="FNanchor_581"
href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Such was the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[p. 346]</span> Spartan political
constitution as fixed by Lykurgus; but a century afterwards (so
Plutarch’s account runs), under the kings Polydôrus and Theopompus,
two important alterations were made. A rider was then attached to
the old Lykurgean Rhetra, by which it was provided that, “in case
the people decided crookedly, the senate, with the kings, should
reverse their decisions:”<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582"
class="fnanchor">[582]</a> while<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_347">[p. 347]</span> another change, perhaps intended as
a sort of compensation for this bridle on the popular assembly,
introduced into the constitution a new executive Directory of five
men, called Ephors. This Board—annually chosen, by some capricious
method, the result of which could not well be foreseen, and open to
be filled by every Spartan citizen—either originally received, or
gradually drew to itself, functions so extensive and commanding,
in regard to internal administration and police, as to limit the
authority of the kings to little more than the exclusive command
of the military force. Herodotus was informed, at Sparta, that
the ephors as well as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[p.
348]</span> senate had been constituted by Lykurgus; but the
authority of Aristotle, as well as the internal probability of the
case, sanctions the belief that they were subsequently added.<a
id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>Taking the political constitution of Sparta ascribed to Lykurgus,
it appears not to have differed materially from the rude organization
exhibited in the Homeric poems, where we always find a council of
chiefs or old men, and occasional meetings of a listening agora. It
is hard to suppose that the Spartan kings can ever have governed
without some formalities of this sort; so that the innovation
(if innovation there really was) ascribed to Lykurgus, must have
consisted in some new details respecting the senate and the
agora,—in fixing the number<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584"
class="fnanchor">[584]</a> thirty, and the life-tenure of the
former,—and the special place of meeting of the latter, as well
as the extent of privilege which it was to exercise; consecrating
the whole by the erection of the temples of Zeus Hellanius and
Athênê Hellania. The view of the subject presented by Plutarch
as well as by Plato,<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585"
class="fnanchor">[585]</a> as if the senate were an entire novelty,
does not consist with the pictures of the old epic. Hence we may
more naturally imagine that the Lykurgean political constitution,
apart from the ephors who were afterwards tacked to it, presents only
the old features of the heroic government of Greece, defined and
regularized in a particular manner. The presence of two coexistent
and coordinate kings, indeed, succeeding in hereditary descent, and
both belonging to the gens of Herakleids, is<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_349">[p. 349]</span> something peculiar to Sparta,—the
origin of which receives no other explanation than a reference to
the twin sons of Aristodêmus, Eurysthenês and Proklês. These two
primitive ancestors are a type of the two lines of Spartan kings; for
they are said to have passed their lives in perpetual dissensions,
which was the habitual state of the two contemporaneous kings at
Sparta. While the coexistence of the pair of kings, equal in power
and constantly thwarting each other, had often a baneful effect upon
the course of public measures, it was, nevertheless, a security
to the state against successful violence,<a id="FNanchor_586"
href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> ending in the
establishment of a despotism, on the part of any ambitious individual
among the regal line.</p>

<p>During five successive centuries of Spartan history, from
Polydôrus and Theopompus downward, no such violence was attempted
by any of the kings,<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587"
class="fnanchor">[587]</a> until the times of Agis the Third
and Kleomenês the Third,—240 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> to 220
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> The importance of Greece had at this
last-mentioned period irretrievably declined, and the independent
political action which she once possessed had become subordinate
to the more powerful force either of the Ætolian mountaineers (the
rudest among her own sons) or to Epirotic, Macedonian, and Asiatic
foreigners, preparatory to the final absorption by the Romans.
But amongst all the Grecian states, Sparta had declined the most;
her ascendency was totally gone, and her peculiar training and
discipline (to which she had chiefly owed it) had degenerated in
every way. Under these untoward circumstances, two young kings,
Agis and Kleomenês,—the former a generous enthusiast, the latter
more violent and ambitious,—conceived the design of restoring the
Lykurgean constitution in its supposed pristine purity, with the hope
of reviving both the spirit of the people and the ascendency of the
state. But the Lykurgean constitution had been, even in the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[p. 350]</span> time of Xenophon,<a
id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
in part, an <i>idéal</i> not fully realized in practice—much less
was it a reality in the days of Kleomenês and Agis moreover, it
was an <i>idéal</i> which admitted of being colored according to the
fancy or feelings of those reformers who professed, and probably
believed, that they were aiming at its genuine restoration. What
the reforming kings found most in their way, was the uncontrolled
authority, and the conservative dispositions, of the ephors,—which
they naturally contrasted with the original fulness of the kingly
power, when kings and senate stood alone. Among the various ways in
which men’s ideas of what the primitive constitution <i>had</i> been,
were modified by the feelings of their own time (we shall presently
see some other instances of this), is probably to be reckoned the
assertion of Kleomenês respecting the first appointment of the
ephors. Kleomenês affirmed that the ephors had originally been
nothing more than subordinates and deputies of the kings, chosen
by the latter to perform for a time their duties during the long
absence of the Messenian war. Starting from this humble position, and
profiting by the dissensions of the two kings,<a id="FNanchor_589"
href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> they had in process
of time, especially by the ambition of the ephor Asterôpus, found
means first to constitute themselves an independent board, then to
usurp to themselves more and more of the kingly authority, until they
at last reduced the kings to a state of intolerable humiliation and
impotence. As a proof of the primitive relation between the kings
and the ephors, he alluded to that which was the custom at Sparta
in his own time. When the ephors sent for either of the kings, the
latter had a right to refuse obedience to two successive summonses,
but the third summons he was bound to obey.<a id="FNanchor_590"
href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that the fact here adduced by Kleomenês (a curious
point in Spartan manners) contributes little to prove the conclusion
which he deduced from it, of the original nomination of the ephors
as mere deputies by the kings. That they were first appointed at
the time of the Messenian war is probable, and coincides with the
tale that king Theopompus was a consenting<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_351">[p. 351]</span> party to the measure,—that their
functions were at first comparatively circumscribed, and extended
by successive encroachments, is also probable; but they seem to
have been from the beginning a board of specially popular origin,
in contraposition to the kings and the senate. One proof of this is
to be found in the ancient oath, which was every month interchanged
between the kings and the ephors; the king swearing for himself, that
he would exercise his regal functions according to the established
laws,—the ephors swearing on behalf of the city, that his authority
should on that condition remain unshaken.<a id="FNanchor_591"
href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> This mutual
compact, which probably formed a part of the ceremony during
the monthly sacrifices offered by the king,<a id="FNanchor_592"
href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> continued down to a
time when it must have become a pure form, and when the kings had
long been subordinate in power to the ephors. But it evidently began
first as a reality,—when the king was predominant and effective chief
of the state, and when the ephors, clothed with functions chiefly
defensive, served as guarantees to the people against abuse of the
regal authority. Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero,<a id="FNanchor_593"
href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> all interpret the
original institution of the ephors as designed to protect the people
and restrain the kings: the latter assimilates them to the tribunes
at Rome.</p>

<p>Such were the relations which had once subsisted between the
kings and the ephors: though in later times these relations had
been so completely reversed, that Polybius considers the former
as essentially subordinate to the latter,—reckoning it as a point
of duty in the kings to respect the ephors “as their fathers.”<a
id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
And such is decidedly the state of things throughout<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[p. 352]</span> all the better-known
period of history which we shall hereafter traverse. The ephors
are the general directors of public affairs<a id="FNanchor_595"
href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> and the supreme
controlling board, holding in check every other authority in
the state, without any assignable limit to their powers. The
extraordinary ascendency of these magistrates is particularly
manifested in the fact stated by Aristotle, that they exempted
themselves from the public discipline, so that their self-indulgent
year of office stood in marked contrast with the toilsome exercises
and sober mess common to rich and poor alike. The kings are reduced
to a certain number of special functions, combined with privileges
partly religious, partly honorary: their most important political
attribute is, that they are <i>ex officio</i> generals of the military
force on foreign expeditions. But even here, we trace the sensible
decline of their power. For whereas Herodotus was informed, and
it probably had been the old privilege, that the king could
levy war against whomsoever he chose, and that no Spartan could
impede him on pain of committing sacrilege,<a id="FNanchor_596"
href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>—we shall see,
throughout the best-known periods of this history, that it is usually
the ephors (with or without the senate and public assembly) who
determine upon war,—the king only takes the command when the army
is put on the march. Aristotle seems to treat the Spartan king as
a sort of hereditary general; but even in this privilege, shackles
were put upon him,—for two, out of the five ephors, accompanied the
army, and their power seems to have been not seldom invoked to insure
obedience to his orders.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597"
class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>The direct political powers of the kings were thus greatly
curtailed; yet importance, in many ways, was still left to
them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[p. 353]</span> They
possessed large royal domains, in many of the townships of the
Periœki: they received frequent occasional presents, and when victims
were offered to the gods, the skins and other portions belonged
to them as perquisites:<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598"
class="fnanchor">[598]</a> they had their votes in the senate,
which, if they were absent, were given on their behalf, by such
of the other senators as were most nearly related to them: the
adoption of children received its formal accomplishment in their
presence,—and conflicting claims at law, for the hand of an
unbequeathed orphan heiress, were adjudicated by them. But above
all, their root was deep in the religious feelings of the people.
Their preëminent lineage connected the entire state with a divine
paternity. They, the chiefs of the Herakleids, were the special
grantees of the soil of Sparta from the gods,—the occupation of the
Dorians being only sanctified and blest by Zeus for the purpose of
establishing the children of Hêraklês in the valley of the Eurotas.<a
id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>
They represented the state in its relations with the gods, being
by right priests of Zeus Lacedæmon, (the ideas of the god and the
country coalescing into one), and of Zeus Uranius, and offering the
monthly sacrifices necessary to insure divine protection to the
people. Though individual persons might sometimes be put aside,
nothing short of a new divine revelation could induce the Spartans
to step out of the genuine lineage of Eurysthenês and Proklês.
Moreover, the remarkable mourning ceremony, which took place at
the death of every king, seems to indicate that the two kingly
families—which counted themselves Achæan,<a id="FNanchor_600"
href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> not Dorian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[p. 354]</span>—were considered as
the great common bond of union between the three component parts
of the population of Laconia,—Spartans, Periœki, and Helots. Not
merely was it required, on this occasion, that two members of every
house in Sparta should appear in sackcloth and ashes,—but the
death of the king was formally made known throughout every part of
Laconia, and deputies from the townships of the Periœki, and the
villages of the Helots, to the number of several thousand, were
summoned to Sparta to take their share in the profuse and public
demonstrations of sorrow,<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601"
class="fnanchor">[601]</a> which lasted for ten days, and which
imparted to the funeral obsequies a superhuman solemnity. Nor ought
we to forget, in enumerating the privileges of the Spartan king, that
he (conjointly with two officers called Pythii, nominated by him,)
carried on the communications between the state and the temple of
Delphi, and had the custody of oracles and prophecies generally. In
most of the Grecian states, such inspired declarations were treasured
up, and consulted in cases of public emergency: but the intercourse
of Sparta with the Delphian oracle was peculiarly frequent and
intimate, and the responses of the Pythian priestess met with more
reverential attention from the Spartans than from any other Greeks.<a
id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> So
much the more important were the king’s functions, as the medium of
this intercourse: the oracle always upheld his dignity, and often
even seconded his underhand personal schemes.<a id="FNanchor_603"
href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>Sustained by so great a force of traditional reverence, a
Spartan king, of military talent and individual energy, like
Agesilaus, exercised great ascendency; but such cases were very
rare, and we shall find the king throughout the historical period
only a secondary force, available on special occasions. For real
political orders, in the greatest cases as well as the least, the
Spartan looks to the council of ephors, to whom obedience is paid
with a degree of precision which nothing short of the Spartan
discipline could have brought about,—by the most powerful<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[p. 355]</span> citizens not less
than by the meanest.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604"
class="fnanchor">[604]</a> Both the internal police and the foreign
affairs of the state are in the hands of the ephors, who exercise
an authority approaching to despotism, and altogether without
accountability. They appoint and direct the body of three hundred
young and active citizens, who performed the immediate police service
of Laconia: they cashier at pleasure any subordinate functionary,
and inflict fine or arrest at their own discretion: they assemble
the military force, on occasion of foreign war, and determine
its destination, though the king has the actual command of it:
they imprison on suspicion even the regent or the king himself:<a
id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
they sit as judges, sometimes individually and sometimes as a
board, upon causes and complaints of great moment, and they judge
without the restraint of written laws, the use of which was
peremptorily forbidden by a special Rhetra,<a id="FNanchor_606"
href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_356">[p. 356]</span> erroneously connected with
Lykurgus himself, but at any rate ancient. On certain occasions
of peculiar moment, they take the sense of the senate and the
public assembly,<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607"
class="fnanchor">[607]</a>—such seems to have been the habit on
questions of war and peace. It appears, however, that persons
charged with homicide, treason, or capital offences generally, were
tried before the senate. We read of several instances in which the
kings were tried and severely fined, and in which their houses were
condemned to be razed to the ground, probably by the senate, on
the proposition of the ephors: in one instance, it seems that the
ephors inflicted by their own authority a fine even upon Agesilaus.<a
id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>War and peace appear to have been submitted, on most, if not on
all occasions, to the senate and the public assembly; no matter could
reach the latter until it had passed through the former. And we find
some few occasions on which the decision of the public assembly was
a real expression of opinion, and operative as to the result,—as,
for example, the assembly which immedi<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_357">[p. 357]</span>ately preceded and resolved upon the
Peloponnesian war. Here, in addition to the serious hazard of the
case, and the general caution of a Spartan temperament, there was the
great personal weight and experience of king Archidamus opposed to
the war, though the ephors were favorable to it.<a id="FNanchor_609"
href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> The public assembly,
under such peculiar circumstances, really manifested an opinion
and came to a division. But, for the most part, it seems to have
been little better than an inoperative formality. The general
rule permitted no open discussion, nor could any private citizen
speak except by special leave from the magistrates. Perhaps even
the general liberty to discuss, if given, might have been of no
avail, for not only was there no power of public speaking, but
no habit of canvassing public measures, at Sparta; nothing was
more characteristic of the government than the extreme secrecy
of its proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610"
class="fnanchor">[610]</a> The propositions brought forward by the
magistrates were either accepted or rejected, without any license of
amending. There could be no attraction to invite the citizen to be
present at such an assembly: and we may gather from the language of
Xenophon that, in his time, it consisted only of a certain number of
notables specially summoned in addition to the senate, which latter
body is itself called “the lesser Ekklesia.<a id="FNanchor_611"
href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>” Indeed, the constant
and formidable diminution in the number of qualified citizens
was alone sufficient to thin the attendance of the assembly, as
well as to break down any imposing force which it might once have
possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[p. 358]</span>An assembly
thus circumstanced,—though always retained as a formality, and
though its consent on considerable matters and for the passing
of laws (which, however, seems to have been a rare occurrence at
Sparta) was indispensable,—could be very little of a practical check
upon the administration of the ephors. The senate, a permanent
body, with the kings included in it, was the only real check upon
them, and must have been to a certain extent a concurrent body in
the government,—though the large and imposing language in which
its political supremacy is spoken of by Demosthenês and Isokratês
exceeds greatly the reality of the case. Its most important
function was that of a court of criminal justice, before whom every
man put on trial for his life was arraigned.<a id="FNanchor_612"
href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> But both in this and
in their other duties, we find the senators as well as the kings and
the ephors charged with corruption and venality.<a id="FNanchor_613"
href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> As they were not
appointed until sixty years of age, and then held their offices for
life, we may readily believe that some of them continued to act after
the period of extreme and disqualifying senility,—which, though
the extraordinary respect of the Lacedæmonians for old age would
doubtless tolerate it, could not fail to impair the influence of the
body as a concurrent element of government.</p>

<p>The brief sketch here given of the Spartan government will show
that, though Greek theorists found a difficulty in determining
under what class they should arrange it,<a id="FNanchor_614"
href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> it was in
substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[p. 359]</span> a
close, unscrupulous, and well-obeyed oligarchy,—including within
it, as subordinate, those portions which had once been dominant,
the kings and the senate, and softening the odium, without abating
the mischief, of the system, by its annual change of the ruling
ephors. We must at the same time distinguish the government from
the Lykurgean discipline and education, which doubtless tended
much to equalize rich and poor, in respect to practical life,
habits, and enjoyments. Herodotus (and seemingly, also, Xenophon)
thought that the form just described was that which the government
had originally received from the hand of Lykurgus. Now, though
there is good reason for supposing otherwise, and for believing
the ephors to be a subsequent addition,—yet, the mere fact that
Herodotus was so informed at Sparta, points our attention to one
important attribute of the Spartan polity, which it is proper to
bring into view. This attribute is, its unparalleled steadiness,
for four or five successive centuries, in the midst of governments
like the Grecian, all of which had undergone more or less of
fluctuation. No considerable revolution—not even any palpable
or formal change—occurred in it, from the days of the Messenian
war, down to those of Agis the Third: in spite of the irreparable
blow which the power and territory of the state sustained from
Epameinondas and the Thebans, the form of government, nevertheless,
remained unchanged. It was the only government in Greece which
could trace an unbroken, peaceable descent from a high antiquity,
and from its real or supposed founder. Now this was one of the main
circumstances (among others which will hereafter be mentioned)
of the astonishing ascendency which the Spartans acquired over
the Hellenic mind, and which they will not be found at all to
deserve by any superior ability in the conduct of affairs. The
steadiness of their political sympathies,—exhibited at one time, by
putting down the tyrants, or despots, at another, by overthrowing
the democracies,—stood in the place of ability; and even the
recognized failings of their government were often covered by the
sentiment of respect for its early commencement and uninterrupted
continuance. If such a feeling acted on the Greeks generally,<a
id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
much more powerful was its action upon the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_360">[p. 360]</span> Spartans themselves, in inflaming that
haughty exclusiveness for which they stood distinguished. And it is
to be observed that the Spartan mind continued to be cast on the
old-fashioned scale, and unsusceptible of modernizing influences,
longer than that of most other people of Greece. The ancient
legendary faith, and devoted submission to the Delphian oracle,
remained among them unabated, at a time when various influences had
considerably undermined it among their fellow-Hellens and neighbors.
But though the unchanged title and forms of the government thus
contributed to its imposing effect, both at home and abroad, the
causes of internal degeneracy were not the less really at work, in
undermining its efficiency. It has been already stated, that the
number of qualified citizens went on continually diminishing, and
even of this diminished number a larger proportion than before were
needy, since the landed property tended constantly to concentrate
itself in fewer hands. There grew up in this way a body of
discontent, which had not originally existed, both among the poorer
citizens, and among those who had lost their franchise as citizens;
thus aggravating the danger arising from Periœki and Helots, who will
be presently noticed.</p>

<p>We pass from the political constitution of Sparta to the civil
ranks and distribution, economical relations, and lastly, the
peculiar system of habits, education, and discipline, said to have
been established among the Lacedæmonians by Lykurgus. Here, again,
we shall find ourselves imperfectly informed as to the existing
institutions, and surrounded by confusion when we try to explain how
those institutions arose.</p>

<p>It seems, however, ascertained that the Dorians, in all
their settlements, were divided into three tribes,—the Hylleis,
the Pamphyli, and the Dymanes: in all Dorian cities, moreover,
there were distinguished Herakleid families, from whom œkists
were chosen when new colonies were formed. These three tribes
can be traced at Argos, Sikyôn, Epidaurus, Trœzên, Megara,
Korkyra, and seemingly, also, at Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_616"
href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> The Hylleis
recognized, as their eponym and progenitor, Hyllus, the son of
Hêra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[p. 361]</span>klês,
and were therefore, in their own belief, descended from Hêraklês
himself: we may suppose the Herakleids, specially so called,
comprising the two regal families, to have been the elder brethren
of the tribe of Hylleis, the whole of whom are sometimes spoken
of as Herakleids, or descendants of Hêraklês.<a id="FNanchor_617"
href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> But there seem to
have been also at Sparta, as in other Dorian towns, non-Dorian
inhabitants, apart from these three tribes, and embodied in tribes
of their own. One of these, the Ægeids, said to have come from
Thebes as allies of the Dorian invaders, is named by Aristotle,
Pindar, and Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618"
class="fnanchor">[618]</a>—while the Ægialeis at Sikyôn, the tribe
Hyrnêthia at Argos and Epidaurus, and others, whose titles we do
not know, at Corinth, represent, in like manner, the non-Dorian
portions of their respective communities.<a id="FNanchor_619"
href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> At Corinth, the total
number of tribes is said to have been eight.<a id="FNanchor_620"
href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> But at Sparta, though
we seem to make out the existence of the three Dorian tribes, we do
not know how many tribes there were in all: still less do we know
what relation the Obæ, or Obes, another subordinate distribution of
the people, bore to the tribes. In the ancient Rhetra of Lykurgus,
the Tribes and Obês are directed to be maintained unaltered:
but the statement of O. Müller and Boeckh<a id="FNanchor_621"
href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>—that there were
thirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[p. 362]</span> Obês in
all, ten to each tribe—rests upon no other evidence than a peculiar
punctuation of this Rhetra, which various other critics reject; and
seemingly, with good reason. We are thus left without any information
respecting the Obê, though we know that it was an old, peculiar,
and lasting division among the Spartan people, since it occurs in
the oldest Rhetra of Lykurgus, as well as in late inscriptions of
the date of the Roman empire. In similar inscriptions, and in the
account of Pausanias, there is, however, recognized a classification
of Spartans distinct from and independent of the three old Dorian
tribes, and founded upon the different quarters of the city,—Limnæ,
Mesoa, Pitanê, and Kynosura;<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622"
class="fnanchor">[622]</a> from one of these four was derived the
usual description of a Spartan in the days of Herodotus. There is
reason to suppose that the old Dorian tribes became antiquated
at Sparta, (as the four old Ionian tribes did at Athens,) and
that the topical classification derived from the quarters of the
city superseded it,—these quarters having been originally the
separate villages, of the aggregate of which Sparta was composed.<a
id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
That the number of the old senators, thirty, was connected with the
three Dorian tribes, deriving ten members from each, is probable
enough, though there is no proof of it.</p>

<p>Of the population of Laconia, three main divisions are
recognized,—Spartans, Periœki, and Helots. The first of the three
were the full qualified citizens, who lived in Sparta itself,
fulfilled all the exigences of the Lykurgean discipline, paid
their quota to the Syssitia, or public mess, and were alone
eligible to honors<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624"
class="fnanchor">[624]</a> or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[p.
363]</span> public offices. These men had neither time, nor
taste even, for cultivation of the land, still less for trade or
handicraft: such occupations were inconsistent with the prescribed
training, even if they had not been positively interdicted. They
were maintained from the lands round the city, and from the
large proportion of Laconia which belonged to them; the land
being tilled for them by Helots, who seem to have paid over to
them a fixed proportion of the produce; in some cases, at least,
as much as one-half.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625"
class="fnanchor">[625]</a> Each Spartan retained his qualification,
and transmitted it to his children, on two conditions,—first, that of
submitting to the prescribed discipline; next, that of paying, each,
his stipulated quota to the public mess, which was only maintained
by these individual contributions. The multiplication of children
in the poorer families, after acquisitions of new territory ceased,
continually augmented both the number and the proportion of citizens
who were unable to fulfil the second of these conditions, and who
therefore lost their franchise: so that there arose towards the
close of the Peloponnesian war, a distinction, among the Spartans
themselves, unknown to the earlier times,—the reduced number of
fully qualified citizens being called The Equals, or Peers,—the
disfranchised poor, The Inferiors. The latter, disfranchised as they
were, nevertheless, did not become Periœki: it was probably still
competent to them to resume their qualification, should any favorable
accident enable them to make their contributions to the public
mess.</p>

<p>The Periœkus was also a freeman and a citizen, not of Sparta, but
of some one of the hundred townships of Laconia.<a id="FNanchor_626"
href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Both he<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[p. 364]</span> and the community to
which he belonged received their orders only from Sparta, having
no political sphere of their own, and no share in determining the
movements of the Spartan authorities. In the island of Kythêra,<a
id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
which formed one of the Periœkic townships, a Spartan bailiff resided
as administrator. But whether the same was the case with others, we
cannot affirm: nor is it safe to reason from one of these townships
to all,—there may have been considerable differences in the mode
of dealing with one and another. For they were spread through the
whole of Laconia, some near and some distant from Sparta: the free
inhabitants of Amyklæ must have been Periœki, as well as those of
Kythêra, Thuria, Ætheia, or Aulôn: nor can we presume that the
feeling on the part of the Spartan authorities towards all of
them was the same. Between the Spartans and their neighbors, the
numerous Periœki of Amyklæ, there must have subsisted a degree of
intercourse and mutual relation in which the more distant Periœki
did not partake,—besides, that both the religious edifices and
the festivals of Amyklæ were most reverentially adopted by the
Spartans and exalted into a national dignity: and we seem to
perceive, on some occasions, a degree of consideration manifested
for the Amyklæan hoplites,<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628"
class="fnanchor">[628]</a> such as perhaps other Periœki might
not have obtained. The class-name, Periœki,<a id="FNanchor_629"
href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>—circum<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span>residents, or dwellers
around the city,—usually denoted native inhabitants of inferior
political condition as contrasted with the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_366">[p. 366]</span> full-privileged burghers who lived
in the city, but it did not mark any precise or uniform degree of
inferiority. It is sometimes so used by Aristotle as to imply a
condition no better than that of the Helots, so that, in a large
sense, all the inhabitants of Laconia (Helots as well as the
rest) might have been included in it. But when used in reference
to Laconia, it bears a technical sense, whereby it is placed in
contraposition with the Spartan on one side, and with the Helot on
the other: it means, native freemen and proprietors, grouped in
subordinate communities<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630"
class="fnanchor">[630]</a> with more or less power of local
management, but (like the subject towns belonging to Bern, Zurich,
and most of the old thirteen cantons of Switzerland) embodied in the
Lacedæmonian aggregate, which was governed exclusively by the kings,
senate, and citizens of Sparta.</p>

<p>When we come to describe the democracy of Athens after the
revolution of Kleisthenes, we shall find the demes, or local
townships and villages of Attica, incorporated as equal and
constituent fractions of the integer called The Deme (or The City) of
Athens, so that a demot of Acharnæ or Sphêttus is at the same time a
full Athenian citizen. But the relation of the Periœkic townships to
Sparta is one of inequality and obedience, though both belong to the
same political aggregate, and make up together the free Lacedæmonian
community. In like manner, Orneæ and other places were townships of
men personally free, but politically dependent on Argos,—Akræphiæ
on Thebes,—Chæroneia on Orchomenus,—and various Thessalian towns
on Pharsalus and Larissa.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631"
class="fnanchor">[631]</a> Such, moreover, was, in the main,
the state into which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[p.
367]</span> Athens would have brought her allies, and Thebes the
free Bœotian communities,<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632"
class="fnanchor">[632]</a> if the policy of either of these cities
had permanently prospered. This condition carried with it a sentiment
of degradation, and a painful negation of that autonomy for which
every Grecian community thirsted; while being maintained through
superior force, it had a natural tendency, perhaps without the
deliberate wish of the reigning city, to degenerate into practical
oppression. But in addition to this general tendency, the peculiar
education of a Spartan, while it imparted force, fortitude, and
regimental precision, was at the same time so rigorously peculiar,
that it rendered him harsh, unaccommodating, and incapable of
sympathizing with the ordinary march of Grecian feeling,—not to
mention the rapacity and love of money, which is attested, by good
evidence, as belonging to the Spartan character,<a id="FNanchor_633"
href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> and which we should
hardly have expected to find in the pupils of Lykurgus. As Harmosts
out of their native city,<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634"
class="fnanchor">[634]</a> and in relations with inferiors, the
Spartans seem to have been more unpopular than other Greeks, and we
may presume that a similar haughty roughness pervaded their dealings
with their own Periœki; who were bound to them certainly by no tie
of affection, and who for the most part revolted after the battle of
Leuktra, as soon as the invasion of Laconia by Epameinondas enabled
them to do so with safety.</p>

<p>Isokratês, taking his point of departure from the old Herakleid
legend, with its instantaneous conquest and triple partition of
all Dorian Peloponnesus, among the three Herakleid brethren,
deduces the first origin of the Periœkic townships from internal
seditions among the conquerors of Sparta. According to him, the
period immediately succeeding the conquest was one of fierce<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[p. 368]</span> intestine warfare in
newly-conquered Sparta, between the Few and the Many,—the oligarchy
and the demus. The former being victorious, two important measures
were the consequences of their victory. They banished the defeated
Many from Sparta into Laconia, retaining the residence in Sparta
exclusively for themselves; they assigned to them the smallest and
least fertile half of Laconia, monopolizing the larger and better
for themselves; and they disseminated them into many very small
townships, or subordinate little communities, while they concentrated
themselves entirely at Sparta. To these precautions for insuring
dominion, they added another not less important. They established
among their own Spartan citizens equality of legal privilege and
democratical government, so as to take the greatest securities
for internal harmony; which harmony, according to the judgment of
Isokratês, had been but too effectually perpetuated, enabling the
Spartans to achieve their dominion over oppressed Greece,—like
the accord of pirates<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635"
class="fnanchor">[635]</a> for the spoliation of the peaceful. The
Periœkic townships, he tells us, while deprived of all the privileges
of freemen, were exposed to all the toils, as well as to an unfair
share of the dangers, of war. The Spartan authorities put them in
situations and upon enterprises which they deemed too dangerous for
their own citizens; and, what was still worse, the ephors possessed
the power of putting to death, without any form of preliminary
trial, as many Periœki as they pleased.<a id="FNanchor_636"
href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p>The statement here delivered by Isokratês, respecting the first
origin of the distinction of Spartans and Periœki, is nothing better
than a conjecture, nor is it even a probable conjecture, since it
is based on the historical truth of the old Herakleid legend, and
transports the disputes of his own time, between the oligarchy
and the demus, into an early period, to which such dis<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[p. 369]</span>putes do not belong.
Nor is there anything, so far as our knowledge of Grecian history
extends, to bear out his assertion, that the Spartans took to
themselves the least dangerous post in the field, and threw undue
peril upon their Periœki. Such dastardly temper was not among the
sins of Sparta; but it is undoubtedly true that, as the number of
citizens continually diminished, so the Periœki came to constitute,
in the later times, a larger and larger proportion of the Spartan
force. Yet the power which Isokratês represents to have been vested
in the ephors, of putting to death Periœki without preliminary
trial, we may fully believe to be real, and to have been exercised
as often as the occasion seemed to call for it. We shall notice,
presently, the way in which these magistrates dealt with the Helots,
and shall see ample reason from thence to draw the conclusion that,
whenever the ephors believed any man to be dangerous to the public
peace,—whether an inferior Spartan, a Periœkus, or a Helot,—the most
summary mode of getting rid of him would be considered as the best.
Towards Spartans of rank and consideration, they were doubtless
careful and measured in their application of punishment, but the
same necessity for circumspection did not exist with regard to the
inferior classes: moreover, the feeling that the exigences of justice
required a fair trial before punishment was inflicted, belongs to
Athenian associations much more than to Spartan. How often any such
summary executions may have taken place, we have no information.</p>

<p>We may remark that the account which Isokratês has here given of
the origin of the Laconian Periœki is not essentially irreconcilable
with that of Ephorus,<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637"
class="fnanchor">[637]</a> who recounted that Eurysthenês and
Proklês, on first conquering Laconia, had granted to the preëxisting
population equal rights with the Dorians,—but that Agis, son of
Eurysthenês, had deprived them of this equal position, and degraded
them into dependent subjects of the latter. At least, the two
narratives both agree in presuming that the Periœki had once enjoyed
a better position, from which they had been extruded by violence.
And the policy which Isokratês ascribes to the victorious Spartan
oligarchs,—of driving out the demus from concentrated residence in
the city to disseminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[p.
370]</span> residence in many separate and insignificant
townships,—seems to be the expression of that proceeding which
in his time was numbered among the most efficient precautions
against refractory subjects,—the Diœkisis, or breaking up of a
town-aggregate into villages. We cannot assign to the statement
any historical authority.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638"
class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Moreover, the division of Laconia into
six districts, together with its distribution into townships (or the
distribution of settlers into preëxisting townships), which Ephorus
ascribed to the first Dorian kings, are all deductions from the
primitive legendary account, which described the Dorian conquest as
achieved by one stroke, and must all be dismissed, if we suppose it
to have been achieved gradually. This gradual conquest is admitted
by O. Müller, and by many of the ablest subsequent inquirers,—who,
nevertheless, seem to have the contrary supposition involuntarily
present to their minds when they criticize the early Spartan history,
and always unconsciously imagine the Spartans as masters of all
Laconia. We cannot even assert that Laconia was ever under one
government before the consummation of the successive conquests of
Sparta.</p>

<p>Of the assertion of O. Müller—repeated by
Schömann<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639"
class="fnanchor">[639]</a>—“that the difference of races was
strictly preserved, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[p.
371]</span> the Periœki were always considered as Achæans,”—I
find no proof, and I believe it to be erroneous. Respecting
Pharis, Geronthræ, and Amyklæ, three Periœkic towns, Pausanias
gives us to understand that the preëxisting inhabitants either
retired or were expelled on the Dorian conquest, and that a Dorian
population replaced them.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640"
class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Without placing great faith in this
statement, for which Pausanias could hardly have any good authority,
we may yet accept it as representing the probabilities of the case,
and as counterbalancing the unsupported hypothesis of Müller. The
Periœkic townships were probably composed either of Dorians entirely,
or of Dorians incorporated in greater or less proportion with the
preëxisting inhabitants. But whatever difference of race there
may once have been, it was effaced before the historical times,<a
id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
during which we find no proof of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span> Achæans, known as such, in Laconia.
The Herakleids, the Ægeids, and the Talthybiads, all of whom belong
to Sparta, seem to be the only examples of separate races, partially
distinguishable from Dorians, known after the beginning of authentic
history. The Spartans and the Periœki constitute one political
aggregate, and that too so completely melted together in the general
opinion (speaking of the times before the battle of Leuktra), that
the peace of Antalkidas, which guaranteed autonomy to every separate
Grecian city, was never so construed as to divorce the Periœkic
towns from Sparta. Both are known as Laconians, or Lacedæmonians,
and Sparta is regarded by Herodotus only as the first and bravest
among the many and brave Lacedæmonian cities.<a id="FNanchor_642"
href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> The victors at
Olympia are proclaimed, not as Spartans, but as Laconians,—a title
alike borne by the Periœki. And many of the numerous winners, whose
names we read in the Olympic lists as Laconians, may probably have
belonged to Amyklæ or other Periœkic towns.</p>

<p>The Periœkic hoplites constituted always a large—in later times
a preponderant—numerical proportion of the Lacedæmonian army, and
must undoubtedly have been trained, more or less perfectly, in
the peculiar military tactics of Sparta; since they were called
upon to obey the same orders as the Spartans in the field,<a
id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>
and to perform the same evolutions. Some cases appear, though rare,
in which a Periœkus has high command in a foreign expedition. In
the time of Aristotle, the larger proportion of Laconia (then
meaning only the country eastward of Taygetus,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_373">[p. 373]</span> since the foundation of Messênê by
Epameinondas had been consummated) belonged to Spartan citizens,<a
id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>
but the remaining smaller half must have been the property of the
Periœki, who must besides have carried on most of the commerce of
export and import,—the metallurgic enterprise, and the distribution
of internal produce,—which the territory exhibited; since no Spartan
ever meddled in such occupations. And thus the peculiar training
of Lykurgus, by throwing all these employments into the hands of
the Periœki, opened to them a new source of importance, which the
dependent townships of Argos, of Thebes, or of Orchomenus, would not
enjoy.</p>

<p>The Helots of Laconia were Coloni, or serfs, bound to the
soil, who tilled it for the benefit of the Spartan proprietors
certainly,—probably, of Periœkic proprietors also. They were the
rustic population of the country, who dwelt, not in towns, but
either in small villages<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645"
class="fnanchor">[645]</a> or in detached farms, both in the district
imme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[p. 374]</span>diately
surrounding Sparta, and round the Periœkic Laconian towns also. Of
course, there were also Helots who lived in Sparta and other towns,
and did the work of domestic slaves,—but such was not the general
character of the class. We cannot doubt that the Dorian conquest
from Sparta found this class in the condition of villagers and
detached rustics; but whether they were dependent upon preëxisting
Achæan proprietors, or independent, like much of the Arcadian
village population, is a question which we cannot answer. In either
case, however, it is easy to conceive that the village lands (with
the cultivators upon them) were the most easy to appropriate for
the benefit of masters resident at Sparta; while the towns, with
the district immediately around them, furnished both dwelling and
maintenance to the outgoing detachments of Dorians. If the Spartans
had succeeded in their attempt to enlarge their territory by the
conquest of Arcadia,<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646"
class="fnanchor">[646]</a> they might very probably have converted
Tegea and Mantineia into Periœkic towns, with a diminished territory
inhabited (either wholly or in part) by Dorian settlers,—while
they would have made over to proprietors in Sparta much of the
village lands of the Mænalii, Azanes, and Parrhasii, helotizing the
inhabitants. The distinction between a town and a village population
seems the main ground of the different treatment of Helots and
Periœki in Laconia. A considerable proportion of the Helots were
of genuine Dorian race, being the Dorian Messenians west of Mount
Taygetus, subsequently conquered and aggregated to this class of
dependent cultivators, who, as a class, must have begun to exist
from the very first establishment of the invading Dorians in the
district round Sparta. From whence the name of Helots arose, we do
not clearly make out: Ephorus deduced it from the town of Helus,
on the southern coast, which the Spartans are said to have taken
after a resistance so obstinate as to provoke them to deal very
rigorously with the captives. There are many reasons for rejecting
this story, and another etymology has been proposed, according to
which Helot is synonymous with <i>captive</i>: this is more plausible,
yet still not convincing.<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647"
class="fnanchor">[647]</a> The Helots lived in the rural villages,
as <i>adscripti glebæ</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[p.
375]</span> cultivating their lands and paying over their rent to
the master at Sparta, but enjoying their homes, wives, families,
and mutual neighborly feelings, apart from the master’s view. They
were never sold out of the country, and probably never sold at
all; belonging, not so much to the master as to the state, which
constantly called upon them for military service, and recompensed
their bravery or activity with a grant of freedom. Meno, the
Thessalian of Pharsalus, took out three hundred Penestæ of his own,
to aid the Athenians against Amphipolis: these Thessalian Penestæ
were in many points analogous to the Helots, but no individual
Spartan possessed the like power over the latter. The Helots were
thus a part of the state, having their domestic and social sympathies
developed, a certain power of acquiring property,<a id="FNanchor_648"
href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> and the consciousness
of Grecian lineage and dialect,—points of marked superiority over the
foreigners who formed the slave population of Athens or Chios. They
seem to have been noway inferior to any village population of Greece;
while the Grecian observer sympathized with them more strongly than
with the bought slaves of other states,—not to mention that their
homogeneous aspect, their numbers, and their employment in military
service, rendered them more conspicuous to the eye.</p>

<p>The service in the Spartan house was all performed by members
of the Helot class; for there seem to have been few, if any,
other slaves in the country. The various anecdotes which are told
respecting their treatment at Sparta, betoken less of cruelty than
of ostentatious scorn,<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649"
class="fnanchor">[649]</a>—a sentiment which we are noway surprised
to discover among the citizens at the mess-table. But the great
mass of the Helots, who dwelt in the country, were objects of
a very different sentiment on the part of the Spartan ephors,
who knew their bravery, energy, and standing discontent,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[p. 376]</span> and yet were forced
to employ them as an essential portion of the state army. The
Helots commonly served as light-armed, in which capacity the
Spartan hoplites could not dispense with their attendance. At
the battle of Platæa, every Spartan hoplite had seven Helots,<a
id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> and
every Periœkic hoplite one Helot, to attend him:<a id="FNanchor_651"
href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> but, even in camp,
the Spartan arrangements were framed to guard against any sudden
mutiny of these light-armed companions, while, at home, the citizen
habitually kept his shield disjoined from its holding-ring, to
prevent the possibility of its being snatched for the like purpose.
Sometimes, select Helots were clothed in heavy armor, and thus served
in the ranks, receiving manumission from the state as the reward
of distinguished bravery.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652"
class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<p>But Sparta, even at the maximum of her power, was more than once
endangered by the reality, and always beset with the apprehension,
of Helotic revolt. To prevent or suppress it, the ephors submitted
to insert express stipulations for aid in their treaties with
Athens,—to invite Athenian troops into the heart of Laconia,—and to
practice combinations of cunning and atrocity which even yet stand
without parallel in the long list of precautions for fortifying
unjust dominion. It was in the eighth year of the Peloponnesian
war, after the Helots had been called upon for signal military
efforts in various ways, and when the Athenians and Messenians
were in possession of Pylus, that the ephors felt especially
apprehensive of an outbreak. Anxious to single<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_377">[p. 377]</span> out the most forward and daring Helots,
as the men from whom they had most to dread, they issued proclamation
that every member of that class who had rendered distinguished
services should make his claims known at Sparta, promising liberty to
the most deserving. A large number of Helots came forward to claim
the boon: not less than two thousand of them were approved, formally
manumitted, and led in solemn procession round the temples, with
garlands on their heads, as an inauguration to their coming life of
freedom. But the treacherous garland only marked them out as victims
for the sacrifice: every man of them forthwith disappeared,—the
manner of their death was an untold mystery.</p>

<p>For this dark and bloody deed, Thucydidês is our witness,<a
id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
and Thucydidês describing a contemporary matter into which he had
inquired. Upon any less evidence we should have hesitated to believe
the statement; but standing as it thus does above all suspicion,
it speaks volumes as to the inhuman character of the Lacedæmonian
government, while it lays open to us at the same time the intensity
of their fears from the Helots. In the assassination of this fated
regiment of brave men, a large number of auxiliaries and instruments
must have been concerned: yet Thucydidês, with all his inquiries,
could not find out how any of them perished: he tells us, that
no man knew. We see here a fact which demonstrates unequivocally
the impenetrable mystery in which the proceedings of the Spartan
government were wrapped,—the absence not only of public discussion,
but of public curiosity,—and the perfection with which the ephors
reigned over the will, the hands, and the tongues, of their Spartan
subjects. The Venetian Council of Ten, with all the facilities for
nocturnal drowning which their city presented, could hardly have
accomplished so vast a <i>coup-d’état</i> with such invisible means. And
we may judge from hence, even if we had no other evidence, how little
the habits of a public assembly could have suited either the temper
of mind or the march of government at Sparta.</p>

<p>Other proceedings, ascribed to the ephors against the Helots, are
conceived in the same spirit as the incident just recounted<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[p. 378]</span> from Thucydidês, though
they do not carry with them the same certain attestation. It was a
part of the institutions of Lykurgus (according to a statement which
Plutarch professes to have borrowed from Aristotle) that the ephors
should every year declare war against the Helots, in order that the
murder of them might be rendered innocent; and that active young
Spartans should be armed with daggers and sent about Laconia, in
order that they might, either in solitude or at night, assassinate
such of the Helots as were considered formidable.<a id="FNanchor_654"
href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> This last measure
passes by the name of the Krypteia, yet we find some difficulty in
determining to what extent it was ever realized. That the ephors,
indeed, would not be restrained by any scruples of justice or
humanity, is plainly shown by the murder of the two thousand Helots
above noticed; but this latter incident really answered its purpose,
while a standing practice, such as that of the Krypteia, and a
formal notice of war given beforehand, would provoke the reaction of
despair rather than enforce tranquillity. There seems, indeed, good
evidence that the Krypteia was a real practice,<a id="FNanchor_655"
href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>—that the ephors
kept up a system of police or espionage throughout Laconia, by
the employment of active young citizens, who lived a hard and
solitary life, and suffered their motions to be as little detected
as possible. The ephors might naturally enough take this method
of keeping watch both over the Periœkic townships and the Helot
villages, and the assassination of individual Helots by these
police-men, or Krypts, would probably pass unnoticed. But it is
impossible to believe in any standing murderous order, or deliberate
annual assassination of Helots, for the purpose of intimidation,
as Aristotle is alleged to have represented,—for we may well doubt
whether he really did make such a representation, when we see that he
takes no notice of this measure in his Politics, where he speaks at
some length both of the Spartan constitution and of the Helots. The
well-known hatred and fear, entertained by the Spartans towards their
Helots, has probably colored Plutarch’s description of the Krypteia,
so as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[p. 379]</span>
exaggerate those unpunished murders which occasionally happened into
a constant phenomenon with express design. A similar deduction is to
be made from the statement of Myrôn of Priênê,<a id="FNanchor_656"
href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> who alleged that they
were beaten every year without any special fault, in order to put
them in mind of their slavery,—and that those Helots, whose superior
beauty or stature placed them above the visible stamp of their
condition, were put to death; while such masters as neglected to keep
down the spirit of their vigorous Helots were punished. That secrecy,
for which the ephors were so remarkable, seems enough of itself to
refute the assertion that they publicly proclaimed war against the
Helots; though we may well believe that this unhappy class of men may
have been noticed as objects for jealous observation in the annual
ephoric oath of office. Whatever may have been the treatment of the
Helots in later times, it is at all events hardly to be supposed
that any regulation hostile to them can have emanated from Lykurgus.
For the dangers arising from that source did not become serious
until after the Messenian war,—nor, indeed, until after the gradual
diminution of the number of Spartan citizens had made itself felt.</p>

<p>The manumitted Helots did not pass into the class of Periœki,—for
this purpose a special grant, of the freedom of some Periœkic
township, would probably be required,—but constituted a class apart,
known at the time of the Peloponnesian war by the name of Neodamôdes.
Being persons who had earned their liberty by signal bravery, they
were of course regarded by the ephors with peculiar apprehension,
and, if possible, employed on foreign service,<a id="FNanchor_657"
href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> or planted on some
foreign soil as settlers. In what manner these freedmen employed
themselves, we find no distinct information; but we can hardly
doubt that they quitted the Helot village and field, together with
the rural costume (the leather cap and sheepskin) which the Helot
commonly wore, and the change of which exposed him to suspicion, if
not to punishment, from his jealous masters. Probably they, as well
as the disfranchised Spartan citizens (called Hypomeiones,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[p. 380]</span> or Inferiors), became
congregated at Sparta, and found employment either in various trades
or in the service of the government.</p>

<p>It has been necessary to give this short sketch of the orders of
men who inhabited Laconia, in order to enable us to understand the
statements given about the legislation of Lykurgus. The arrangements
ascribed to that lawgiver, in the way that Plutarch describes
them, presuppose, and do not create, the three orders of Spartans,
Periœki, and Helots. We are told by Plutarch that the disorders
which Lykurgus found existing in the state arose in a great measure
from the gross inequality of property, and from the luxurious
indulgence and unprincipled rapacity of the rich,—who had drawn
to themselves the greater proportion of the lands in the country,
leaving a large body of poor, without any lot of land, in hopeless
misery and degradation. To this inequality (according to Plutarch)
the reforming legislator applied at once a stringent remedy. He
redistributed the whole territory belonging to Sparta, as well as
the remainder of Laconia; the former, in nine thousand equal lots,
one to each Spartan citizen; the latter, in thirty thousand equal
lots, one to each Periœkus: of this alleged distribution, I shall
speak farther presently. Moreover, he banished the use of gold and
silver money, tolerating nothing in the shape of circulating medium
but pieces of iron, heavy and scarcely portable; and he forbade<a
id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> to
the Spartan citizen every species of industrious or money-seeking
occupation, agriculture included. He farther constituted,—though not
without strenuous opposition, during the course of which his eye is
said to have been knocked out by a violent youth, named Alkander,—the
Syssitia, or public mess. A certain number of joint tables were
provided, and every citizen was required to belong to some one of
them, and habitually to take his meals at it,<a id="FNanchor_659"
href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>—no new member being
admissible without an unanimous ballot in his favor by the previous
occupants. Each provided from his lot of land a specified quota
of barley-meal, wine, cheese, and figs, and a small contribution
of money for condiments: game was obtained in addition by hunting
in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[p. 381]</span> public
forests of the state, while every one who sacrificed to the gods,<a
id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
sent to his mess-table a part of the victim killed. From boyhood
to old age, every Spartan citizen took his sober meals at this
public mess, where all shared alike; nor was distinction of any
kind allowed, except on signal occasions of service rendered by an
individual to the state.</p>

<p>These public Syssitia, under the management of the Polemarchs,
were connected with the military distribution, the constant gymnastic
training, and the rigorous discipline of detail, enforced by
Lykurgus. From the early age of seven years, throughout his whole
life, as youth and man no less than as boy, the Spartan citizen
lived habitually in public, always either himself under drill,
gymnastic and military, or a critic and spectator of others,—always
under the fetters and observances of a rule partly military,
partly monastic,—estranged from the independence of a separate
home,—seeing his wife, during the first years after marriage, only
by stealth, and maintaining little peculiar relation with his
children. The supervision, not only of his fellow-citizens, but
also of authorized censors, or captains nominated by the state, was
perpetually acting upon him: his day was passed in public exercises
and meals, his nights in the public barrack to which he belonged.
Besides the particular military drill, whereby the complicated
movements required from a body of Lacedæmonian hoplites in the
field, were made familiar to him from his youth,—he also became
subject to severe bodily discipline of other kinds, calculated to
impart strength, activity, and endurance. To manifest a daring
and pugnacious spirit,—to sustain the greatest bodily torture
unmoved,—to endure hunger and thirst, heat, cold, and fatigue,—to
tread the worst ground barefoot,—to wear the same garment winter
and summer,—to suppress external manifestations of feeling, and
to exhibit in public, when action was not called for, a bearing
shy, silent, and motionless as a statue,—all these were the
virtues of the accomplished Spartan youth.<a id="FNanchor_661"
href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> Two squadrons<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[p. 382]</span> were often matched
against each other to contend (without arms) in the little insular
circumscription called the Platanistûs, and these contests were
carried on, under the eye of the authorities, with the utmost
extremity of fury. Nor was the competition among them less obstinate,
to bear without murmuring the cruel scourgings inflicted before the
altar of Artemis Orthia, supposed to be highly acceptable to the
goddess, though they sometimes terminated even in the death of the
uncomplaining sufferer.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662"
class="fnanchor">[662]</a> Besides the various descriptions of
gymnastic contests, the youths were instructed in the choric dances
employed in festivals of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[p.
383]</span> gods, which contributed to impart to them methodized and
harmonious movements. Hunting in the woods and mountains of Laconia
was encouraged, as a means of inuring them to fatigue and privation.
The nourishment supplied to the youthful Spartans was purposely
kept insufficient, but they were allowed to make up the deficiency
not only by hunting, but even by stealing whatever they could lay
hands upon, provided they could do so without being detected in
the fact; in which latter case they were severely chastised.<a
id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
In reference simply to bodily results,<a id="FNanchor_664"
href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> the training at
Sparta was excellent, combining strength and agility with universal
aptitude and endurance, and steering clear of that mistake by which
Thebes and other cities impaired the effect of their gymnastics,—the
attempt to create an athletic habit, suited for the games, but suited
for nothing else.</p>

<p>Of all the attributes of this remarkable community, there is none
more difficult to make out clearly than the condition and character
of the Spartan women. Aristotle asserts that, in his time, they
were imperious and unruly, without being really so brave and useful
in moments of danger as other Grecian females;<a id="FNanchor_665"
href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> that they possessed
great influence over the men, and even exercised much ascendency
over the course of public affairs; and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_384">[p. 384]</span> that nearly half the landed property
of Laconia had come to belong to them. The exemption of the women
from all control, formed, in his eye, a pointed contrast with the
rigorous discipline imposed upon the men,—and a contrast hardly less
pointed with the condition of women in other Grecian cities, where
they were habitually confined to the interior of the house, and
seldom appeared in public. While the Spartan husband went through
the hard details of his ascetic life, and dined on the plainest fare
at the Pheidition, or mess, the wife (it appears) maintained an
ample and luxurious establishment at home; and the desire to provide
for such outlay was one of the causes of that love of money which
prevailed among men forbidden to enjoy it in the ordinary ways. To
explain this antithesis between the treatment of the two sexes at
Sparta, Aristotle was informed that Lykurgus had tried to bring the
women no less than the men under a system of discipline, but that
they made so obstinate a resistance as to compel him to desist.<a
id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p>The view here given by the philosopher, and deserving of course
careful attention, is not easy to reconcile with that of Xenophon
and Plutarch, who look upon the Spartan women from a different side,
and represent them as worthy and homogeneous companions to the men.
The Lykurgean system (as these authors describe it) considering
the women as a part of the state, and not as a part of the house,
placed them under training hardly less than the men. Its grand
purpose, the maintenance of a vigorous breed of citizens, determined
both the treatment of the younger women, and the regulations as
to the intercourse of the sexes. “Female slaves are good enough
(Lykurgus thought) to sit at home spinning and weaving,—but who
can expect a splendid offspring, the appropriate mission and duty
of a free Spartan woman towards her country, from mothers brought
up in such occupations?”<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667"
class="fnanchor">[667]</a> Pursuant to these views, the Spartan
damsels underwent a bodily training analogous to that of the Spartan
youth,—being formally exercised, and contending with each other
in running, wrestling, and boxing, agreeably to the forms of the
Grecian agônes. They seem to have worn a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_385">[p. 385]</span> light tunic, cut open at the skirts, so
as to leave the limbs both free and exposed to view,—hence Plutarch
speaks of them as completely uncovered, while other critics, in
different quarters of Greece, heaped similar reproach upon the
practice, as if it had been perfect nakedness.<a id="FNanchor_668"
href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> The presence of the
Spartan youths, and even of the kings and the body of citizens, at
these exercises, lent animation to the scene. In like manner, the
young women marched in the religious processions, sung and danced at
particular festivals, and witnessed as spectators the exercises and
contentions of the youths; so that the two sexes were perpetually
intermingled with each other in public, in a way foreign to the
habits, as well as repugnant to the feelings, of other Grecian
states. We may well conceive that such an education imparted to
the women both a demonstrative character and an eager interest in
masculine accomplishments, so that the expression of their praise
was the strongest stimulus, and that of their reproach the bitterest
humiliation, to the youthful troop who heard it.</p>

<p>The age of marriage (which in some of the unrestricted
cities of Greece was so early as to deteriorate visibly the
breed of citizens)<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669"
class="fnanchor">[669]</a> was deferred by the Spartan law, both in
women and men, until the period supposed to be most consistent with
the perfection of the offspring. And when we read the restriction
which Spartan custom imposed upon the intercourse even between
married persons, we shall conclude without hesitation that the
public intermixture of the sexes, in the way just described, led to
no such liberties, between persons not married, as might be likely
to arise from it under other circumstances.<a id="FNanchor_670"
href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_386">[p. 386]</span> Marriage was almost universal among
the citizens, enforced by general opinion at least, if not by law.
The young Spartan carried away his bride by a simulated abduction,
but she still seems, for some time at least, to have continued to
reside with her family, visiting her husband in his barrack in
the disguise of male attire, and on short and stolen occasions.<a
id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a>
To some married couples, according to Plutarch, it happened, that
they had been married long enough to have two or three children,
while they had scarcely seen each other apart by daylight. Secret
intrigue on the part of married women was unknown at Sparta; but
to bring together the finest couples was regarded by the citizens
as desirable, and by the lawgiver as a duty. No personal feeling
or jealousy on the part of the husband found sympathy from any
one,—and he permitted without difficulty, sometimes actively
encouraged, compliances on the part of his wife, consistent with
this generally acknowledged object. So far was such toleration
carried, that there were some married women who were recognized
mistresses of two houses,<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672"
class="fnanchor">[672]</a> and mothers of two distinct families,—a
sort of bigamy strictly forbidden to the men, and never permitted,
except in the remarkable case of king Anaxandrides, when the royal
Herakleidan line of Eurysthenes was in danger of becoming extinct.
The wife of Anaxandrides being childless, the ephors strongly urged
him, on grounds of public necessity, to repudiate her and marry
another. But he refused to dismiss a wife who had given him no
cause of complaint; upon which, when they found him inexorable,
they desired him to retain her, but to marry another wife besides,
in order that at any rate there might be issue to the Eurystheneid
line. “He thus (says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[p.
387]</span> Herodotus) married two wives, and inhabited two
family-hearths, a proceeding unknown at Sparta;”<a id="FNanchor_673"
href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> yet the same
privilege which, according to Xenophon, some Spartan women enjoyed
without reproach from any one, and with perfect harmony between
the inmates of both their houses. O. Müller<a id="FNanchor_674"
href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> remarks—and the
evidence, as far as we know it, bears him out—that love-marriages
and genuine affection towards a wife were more familiar to Sparta
than to Athens; though in the former, marital jealousy was a
sentiment neither indulged nor recognized,—while in the latter, it
was intense and universal.<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675"
class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>To reconcile the careful gymnastic training, which Xenophon and
Plutarch mention, with that uncontrolled luxury and relaxation which
Aristotle condemns in the Spartan women, we may perhaps suppose that,
in the time of the latter, the women of high position and wealth
had contrived to emancipate themselves from the general obligation,
and that it is of such particular cases that he chiefly speaks. He
dwells especially upon the increasing tendency to accumulate property
in the hands of the women,<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676"
class="fnanchor">[676]</a> which seems to have been still more
conspicuous a century afterwards, in the reign of Agis the Third. And
we may readily imagine that one of the employments of wealth thus
acquired would be to purchase exemption from laborious training,—an
object more easy to accomplish in their case than in that of the
men, whose services were required by the state as soldiers. By what
steps so large a proportion as two-fifths of the landed property
of the state came to be possessed by women, he partially explains
to us. There were (he says) many sole heiresses,—the dowries given
by fathers to their daughters were very large,—and the father had
unlimited power of testamentary bequest,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_388">[p. 388]</span> which he was disposed to use to the
advantage of his daughter over his son. In conjunction with this
last circumstance, we have to notice that peculiar sympathy and
yielding disposition towards women in the Spartan mind, of which
Aristotle also speaks,<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677"
class="fnanchor">[677]</a> and which he ascribes to the warlike
temper both of the citizen and the state,—Arês bearing the yoke of
Aphroditê. But, apart from such a consideration, if we suppose, on
the part of a wealthy Spartan father, the simple disposition to
treat sons and daughters alike as to bequest,—nearly one half of the
inherited mass of property would naturally be found in the hands of
the daughters, since on an average of families the number of the two
sexes born is nearly equal. In most societies, it is the men who make
new acquisitions: but this seldom or never happened with Spartan men,
who disdained all money-getting occupations.</p>

<p>Xenophon, a warm panegyrist of Spartan manners, points with some
pride to the tall and vigorous breed of citizens which the Lykurgic
institutions had produced. The beauty of the Lacedæmonian women was
notorious throughout Greece, and Lampitô, the Lacedæmonian woman
introduced in the Lysistrata of Aristophanês, is made to receive
from the Athenian women the loudest compliments upon her fine shape
and masculine vigor.<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678"
class="fnanchor">[678]</a> We may remark that, on this as well as on
the other points, Xenophon emphatically insists on the peculiarity
of Spartan institutions, contradicting thus the views of those who
regard them merely as something a little Hyper-Dorian. Indeed, such
peculiarity seems never to have been questioned in antiquity, either
by the enemies or by the admirers of Sparta. And those who censured
the public masculine exercises of the Spartan maidens, as well as
the liberty tolerated in married women, allowed at the same time
that the feelings of both were actively identified with the state
to a degree hardly known in Greece; that the patriotism of the men
greatly depended upon the sympathy of the other sex, which manifested
itself publicly, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[p.
389]</span> manner not compatible with the recluse life of Grecian
women generally, to the exaltation of the brave as well as to the
abasement of the recreant; and that the dignified bearing of the
Spartan matrons under private family loss seriously assisted the
state in the task of bearing up against public reverses. “Return
either with your shield or upon it,” was their exhortation to their
sons when departing for foreign service: and after the fatal day of
Leuktra, those mothers who had to welcome home their surviving sons
in dishonor and defeat, were the bitter sufferers; while those whose
sons had perished, maintained a bearing comparatively cheerful.<a
id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>Such were the leading points of the memorable Spartan
discipline, strengthened in its effect on the mind by the absence
of communication with strangers. For no Spartan could go abroad
without leave, nor were strangers permitted to stay at Sparta; they
came thither, it seems, by a sort of sufferance, but the uncourteous
process called xenêlasy<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680"
class="fnanchor">[680]</a> was always available to remove them, nor
could there arise in Sparta that class of resident metics or aliens
who constituted a large part of the population of Athens, and seem to
have been found in most other Grecian towns. It is in this universal
schooling, training, and drilling, imposed alike upon boys and men,
youths and virgins, rich and poor, that the distinctive attribute of
Sparta is to be sought,—not in her laws or political constitution.</p>

<p>Lykurgus (or the individual to whom this system is owing, whoever
he was) is the founder of a warlike brotherhood rather than the
lawgiver of a political community; his brethren live together
like bees in a hive (to borrow a simile from Plutarch),<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[p. 390]</span> with all their feelings
implicated in the commonwealth, and divorced from house and home.<a
id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>
Far from contemplating the society as a whole, with its multifarious
wants and liabilities, he interdicts beforehand, by one of the
three primitive Rhetræ, all written laws, that is to say, all
formal and premeditated enactments on any special subject. When
disputes are to be settled or judicial interference is required,
the magistrate is to decide from his own sense of equity; that
the magistrate will not depart from the established customs and
recognized purposes of the city, is presumed from the personal
discipline which he and the select body to whom he belongs, have
undergone. It is this select body, maintained by the labor of others,
over whom Lykurgus exclusively watches, with the provident eye of
a trainer, for the purpose of disciplining them into a state of
regimental preparation,<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682"
class="fnanchor">[682]</a> single-minded obedience, and bodily
efficiency and endurance, so that they may be always fit and ready
for defence, for conquest and for dominion. The parallel of the
Lykurgean institutions is to be found in the Republic of Plato, who
approves the Spartan principle of select guardians carefully trained
and administering the community at discretion; with this momentous
difference, indeed, that the Spartan character<a id="FNanchor_683"
href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> formed by Lykur<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[p. 391]</span>gus is of a low
type, rendered savage and fierce by exclusive and overdone bodily
discipline,—destitute even of the elements of letters,—immersed
in their own narrow specialities, and taught to despise all that
lay beyond,—possessing all the qualities requisite to procure
dominion, but none of those calculated to render dominion popular
or salutary to the subject; while the habits and attributes of the
guardians, as shadowed forth by Plato, are enlarged as well as
philanthropic, qualifying them not simply to govern, but to govern
for purposes protective, conciliatory, and exalted. Both Plato
and Aristotle conceive as the perfection of society something of
the Spartan type,—a select body of equally privileged citizens,
disengaged from industrious pursuits, and subjected to public and
uniform training. Both admit (with Lykurgus) that the citizen
belongs neither to himself nor to his family, but to his city; both
at the same time note with regret, that the Spartan training was
turned only to one portion of human virtue,—that which is called
forth in a state of war;<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684"
class="fnanchor">[684]</a> the citizens being converted into a sort
of garrison, always under drill, and always ready to be called
forth either against Helots at home or against enemies abroad. Such
exclusive tendency will appear less astonishing if we consider the
very early and insecure period at which the Lykurgean institutions
arose, when none of those guarantees which afterwards maintained
the peace of the Hellenic world had as yet become effective,—no
constant habits of intercourse, no custom of meeting in Amphiktyony
from the distant parts of Greece, no common or largely frequented
festivals, no multiplication of proxenies (or standing tickets of
hospitality) between the important cities, no pacific or industrious
habits anywhere. When we contemplate the general insecurity of
Grecian life in the ninth or eighth century before the Christian era,
and especially the precarious condition of a small band of Dorian
conquerors in Sparta and its district, with subdued Helots on their
own lands and Achæans unsubdued all around them,—we shall not be
surprised that the language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[p.
392]</span> which Brasidas in the Peloponnesian war addresses to
his army in reference to the original Spartan settlement, was still
more powerfully present to the mind of Lykurgus four centuries
earlier—“We are a few in the midst of many enemies; we can only
maintain ourselves by fighting and conquering.”<a id="FNanchor_685"
href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>Under such circumstances, the exclusive aim which Lykurgus
proposed to himself is easily understood; but what is truly
surprising, is the violence of his means and the success of the
result. He realized his project of creating, in the eight thousand
or nine thousand Spartan citizens, unrivalled habits of obedience,
hardihood, self-denial, and military aptitude,—complete subjection
on the part of each individual to the local public opinion, and
preference of death to the abandonment of Spartan maxims, intense
ambition on the part of every one to distinguish himself within
the prescribed sphere of duties, with little ambition for anything
else. In what manner so rigorous a system of individual training
can have been first brought to bear upon any community, mastering
the course of the thoughts and actions from boyhood to old age,—a
work far more difficult than any political revolution,—we are not
permitted to discover. Nor does the influence of an earnest and
energetic Herakleidman,—seconded by the still more powerful working
of the Delphian god behind, upon the strong pious susceptibilities
of the Spartan mind,—sufficiently explain a phenomenon so remarkable
in the history of mankind, unless we suppose them aided by some
combination of coöperating circumstances which history has not
transmitted to us,<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686"
class="fnanchor">[686]</a> and preceded by disorders so exaggerated
as to render the citizens glad to escape from them at any price.</p>

<p>Respecting the ante-Lykurgean Sparta we possess no positive
information whatever. But although this unfortunate gap cannot be
filled up, we may yet master the negative probabilities of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[p. 393]</span> case sufficiently to
see that, in what Plutarch has told us (and from Plutarch the modern
views have, until lately, been derived), there is indeed a basis of
reality, but there is also a large superstructure of romance,—in
not a few particulars essentially misleading. For example, Plutarch
treats Lykurgus as introducing his reforms at a time when Sparta was
mistress of Laconia, and distributing the whole of that territory
among the Periœki. Now we know that Laconia was not then in
possession of Sparta, and that the partition of Lykurgus (assuming it
to be real) could only have been applied to the land in the immediate
vicinity of the latter. For even Amyklæ, Pharis, and Geronthræ,
were not conquered until the reign of Têleklus, posterior to any
period which we can reasonably assign to Lykurgus: nor can any such
distribution of Laconia have really occurred. Farther, we are told
that Lykurgus banished from Sparta coined gold and silver, useless
professions and frivolities, eager pursuit of gain, and ostentatious
display. Without dwelling upon the improbability that any one of
these anti-Spartan characteristics should have existed at so early a
period as the ninth century before the Christian era, we may at least
be certain that coined silver was not then to be found, since it was
first introduced into Greece by Pheidon of Argos in the succeeding
century, as has been stated in the preceding section.</p>

<p>But amongst all the points stated by Plutarch, the most suspicious
by far, and the most misleading, because endless calculations have
been built upon it, is the alleged redivision of landed property.
He tells us that Lykurgus found fearful inequality in the landed
possessions of the Spartans; nearly all the land in the hands of a
few, and a great multitude without any land; that he rectified this
evil by a redivision of the Spartan district into nine thousand equal
lots, and the rest of Laconia into thirty thousand, giving to each
citizen as much as would produce a given quota of barley, etc.; and
that he wished, moreover, to have divided the movable property upon
similar principles of equality, but was deterred by the difficulties
of carrying his design into execution.</p>

<p>Now we shall find on consideration that this new and equal
partition of lands by Lykurgus is still more at variance with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[p. 394]</span> fact and probability
than the two former alleged proceedings. All the historical
evidences exhibit decided inequalities of property among the
Spartans,—inequalities which tended constantly to increase; moreover,
the earlier authors do not conceive this evil as having grown up by
way of abuse out of a primeval system of perfect equality, nor do
they know anything of the original equal redivision by Lykurgus.
Even as early as the poet Alkæus (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 600-580) we
find bitter complaints of the oppressive ascendency of wealth, and
the degradation of the poor man, cited as having been pronounced
by Aristodêmus at Sparta: “Wealth (said he) makes the man,—no poor
person is either accounted good or honored.”<a id="FNanchor_687"
href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> Next, the historian
Hellanikus certainly knew nothing of the Lykurgean redivision,—for
he ascribed the whole Spartan polity to Eurysthenês and Proklês,
the original founders, and hardly noticed Lykurgus at all. Again,
in the brief, but impressive description of the Spartan lawgiver by
Herodotus, several other institutions are alluded to, but nothing
is said about a redivision of the lands; and this latter point is
in itself of such transcendent moment, and was so recognized among
all Grecian thinkers, that the omission is almost a demonstration of
ignorance. Thucydidês certainly could not have believed that equality
of property was an original feature in the Lykurgean system; for
he says that, at Lacedæmon, “the rich men assimilated themselves
greatly in respect of clothing and general habits of life to the
simplicity of the poor, and thus set an example which was partially
followed in the rest of Greece:” a remark which both implies the
existence of unequal property, and gives a just appreciation of
the real working of Lykurgic institutions.<a id="FNanchor_688"
href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> The like is the
sentiment of Xenophon:<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689"
class="fnanchor">[689]</a> he observes that the rich at Sparta
gained little by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[p. 395]</span>
their wealth in point of superior comfort; but he never glances at
any original measure carried into effect by Lykurgus for equalizing
possessions. Plato too,<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690"
class="fnanchor">[690]</a> while he touches upon the great advantage
possessed by the Dorians, immediately after their conquest of
Peloponnesus, in being able to apportion land suitably to all,—never
hints that this original distribution had degenerated into an abuse,
and that an entire subsequent redivision had been resorted to by
Lykurgus: moreover, he is himself deeply sensible of the hazards
of that formidable proceeding. Lastly, Aristotle clearly did not
believe that Lykurgus had redivided the soil. For he informs us
first, that, “both in Lacedæmon and in Krete,<a id="FNanchor_691"
href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> the legislator had
rendered the enjoyment of property common through the establishment
of the Syssitia, or public mess.” Now this remark (if read in the
chapter of which it forms a part, a refutation of the scheme of
Communism for the select guardians in the Platonic Republic) will
be seen to tell little for its point, if we assume that Lykurgus at
the same time equalized all individual possessions. Had Aristotle
known that fact, he could not have failed to notice it: nor could
he have assimilated the legislators in Lacedæmon and Krete, seeing
that in the latter no one pretends that any such equalization was
ever brought about. Next, not only does Aristotle dwell upon the
actual inequality of property at Sparta as a serious public evil, but
he nowhere treats this as having grown out of a system of absolute
equality once enacted by the lawgiver as a part of the primitive
constitution: he expressly notices inequality of property so far
back as the second Messenian war. Moreover, in that valuable chapter
of his Politics, where the scheme of equality of possessions is
discussed, Phaleas of Chalkedôn is expressly mentioned as the first
author of it, thus indirectly excluding Lykurgus.<a id="FNanchor_692"
href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> The mere silence
of Aristotle is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[p.
396]</span> this discussion a negative argument of the greatest
weight. Isokratês,<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693"
class="fnanchor">[693]</a> too, speaks much about Sparta for good
and for evil,—mentions Lykurgus as having established a political
constitution much like that of the earliest days of Athens,—praises
the gymnasia and the discipline, and compliments the Spartans upon
the many centuries which they have gone through without violent
sedition, extinction of debts, and redivision of the land,—those
“monstrous evils,” as he terms them. Had he conceived Lykurgus as
being himself the author of a complete redivision of land, he could
hardly have avoided some allusion to it.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that none of the authors down to Aristotle
ascribe to Lykurgus a redivision of the lands, either of Sparta
or of Laconia. The statement to this effect in Plutarch, given in
great detail and with precise specification of number and produce,
must have been borrowed from some author later than Aristotle; and
I think we may trace the source of it, when we study Plutarch’s
biography of Lykurgus in conjunction with that of Agis and
Kleomenês. The statement is taken from authors of the century after
Aristotle, either in, or shortly before, the age when both those
kings tried extreme measures to renovate the sinking state: the
former by a thorough change of system and property, yet proposed
and accepted according to constitutional forms; the latter by
projects substantially similar, with violence to enforce them. The
accumulation of landed property in few hands, the multiplication of
poor, and the decline in the number of citizens, which are depicted
as grave mischiefs by Aristotle, had become<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_397">[p. 397]</span> greatly aggravated during the century
between him and Agis. The number of citizens, reckoned by Herodotus
in the time of the Persian invasion at eight thousand, had dwindled
down in the time of Aristotle to one thousand, and in that of Agis to
seven hundred, out of which latter number one hundred alone possessed
most of the landed property of the state.<a id="FNanchor_694"
href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> Now, by the ancient
rule of Lykurgus, the qualification for citizenship was the ability
to furnish the prescribed quota, incumbent on each individual, at the
public mess: so soon as a citizen became too poor to answer to this
requisition, he lost his franchise and his eligibility to offices.<a
id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
The smaller lots of land, though it was held discreditable either
to buy or sell them,<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696"
class="fnanchor">[696]</a> and though some have asserted<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[p. 398]</span> (without ground, I
think) that it was forbidden to divide them,—became insufficient for
numerous families, and seem to have been alienated in some indirect
manner to the rich; while every industrious occupation being both
interdicted to a Spartan citizen and really inconsistent with his
rigorous personal discipline, no other means of furnishing his
quota, except the lot of land, was open to him. The difficulty felt
with regard to these smaller lots of land may be judged of from the
fact stated by Polybius,<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697"
class="fnanchor">[697]</a> that three or four Spartan brothers had
often one and the same wife, the paternal land being just sufficient
to furnish contributions for all to the public mess, and thus to
keep alive the citizen-rights of all the sons. The tendency to
diminution in the number of Spartan citizens seems to have gone on
uninterruptedly from the time of the Persian war, and must have
been aggravated by the foundation of Messênê, with its independent
territory around, after the battle of Leuktra, an event which robbed
the Spartans of a large portion of their property. Apart from
these special causes, moreover, it has been observed often as a
statistical fact, that a close corporation of citizens, or any small
number of families, inter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[p.
399]</span>marrying habitually among one another, and not reinforced
from without, have usually a tendency to diminish.</p>

<p>The present is not the occasion to enter at length into that
combination of causes which partly sapped, partly overthrew, both
the institutions of Lykurgus and the power of Sparta. But taking the
condition of that city as it stood in the time of Agis the Third
(say about 250 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), we know that its citizens
had become few in number, the bulk of them miserably poor, and all
the land in a small number of hands. The old discipline and the
public mess (as far as the rich were concerned) had degenerated
into mere forms,—a numerous body of strangers or non-citizens (the
old xenêlasy, or prohibition of resident strangers, being long
discontinued) were domiciled in the town, forming a powerful moneyed
interest; and lastly, the dignity and ascendency of the state
amongst its neighbors were altogether ruined. It was insupportable
to a young enthusiast like king Agis, as well as to many ardent
spirits among his contemporaries, to contrast this degradation with
the previous glories of their country: nor did they see any other
way of reconstructing the old Sparta except by again admitting the
disfranchised poor citizens, redividing the lands, cancelling all
debts, and restoring the public mess and military training in all
their strictness. Agis endeavored to carry through these subversive
measures, (such as no demagogue in the extreme democracy of Athens
would ever have ventured to glance at,) with the consent of the
senate and public assembly, and the acquiescence of the rich. His
sincerity is attested by the fact, that his own property, and that
of his female relatives, among the largest in the state, was cast as
the first sacrifice into the common stock. But he became the dupe
of unprincipled coadjutors, and perished in the unavailing attempt
to realize his scheme by persuasion. His successor, Kleomenês,
afterwards accomplished by violence a change substantially similar,
though the intervention of foreign arms speedily overthrew both
himself and his institutions.</p>

<p>Now it was under the state of public feeling which gave birth
to these projects of Agis and Kleomenês at Sparta, that the
historic fancy, unknown to Aristotle and his predecessors, first
gained ground, of the absolute equality of property as a primitive
institution of Lykurgus. How much such a belief would favor<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[p. 400]</span> the schemes of
innovation is too obvious to require notice; and without supposing
any deliberate imposture, we cannot be astonished that the
predispositions of enthusiastic patriots interpreted, according to
their own partialities, an old unrecorded legislation from which
they were separated by more than five centuries. The Lykurgean
discipline tended forcibly to suggest to men’s minds the <i>idea</i> of
equality among the citizens,—that is, the negation of all inequality
not founded on some personal attribute,—inasmuch as it assimilated
the habits, enjoyments, and capacities of the rich to those of the
poor; and the equality thus existing in idea and tendency, which
seemed to proclaim the wish of the founder, was strained by the later
reformers into a positive institution which he had at first realized,
but from which his degenerate followers had receded. It was thus
that the fancies, longings, and indirect suggestions of the present
assumed the character of recollections out of the early, obscure,
and extinct historical past. Perhaps the philosopher Sphærus of
Borysthenês (friend and companion of Kleomenês,<a id="FNanchor_698"
href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> disciple of Zeno the
Stoic, and author of works now lost, both on Lykurgus and Socrates,
and on the constitution of Sparta) may have been one of those who
gave currency to such an hypothesis. And we shall readily believe
that, if advanced, it would find easy and sincere credence, when we
recollect how many similar delusions have obtained vogue in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[p. 401]</span> modern times, far
more favorable to historical accuracy,—how much false coloring has
been attached by the political feeling of recent days to matters of
ancient history, such as the Saxon Witenagemote, the Great Charter,
the rise and growth of the English House of Commons, or even the Poor
Law of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>When we read the division of lands really proposed by king
Agis, it is found to be a very close copy of the original division
ascribed to Lykurgus. He parcels the lands bounded by the four
limits of Pellênê, Sellasia, Malea, and Taygetus, into four thousand
five hundred lots, one to every Spartan; and the lands beyond
these limits into fifteen thousand lots, one to each Periœkus; and
he proposes to constitute in Sparta fifteen pheiditia, or public
mess-tables, some including four hundred individuals, others two
hundred,—thus providing a place for each of his four thousand five
hundred Spartans. With respect to the division originally ascribed
to Lykurgus, different accounts were given. Some considered it
to have set out nine thousand lots for the district of Sparta,
and thirty thousand for the rest of Laconia;<a id="FNanchor_699"
href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> others affirmed that
six thousand lots had been given by Lykurgus, and three thousand
added afterwards by king Polydorus; a third tale was, that Lykurgus
had assigned four thousand five hundred lots, and king Polydorus
as many more. This last scheme is much the same as what was really
proposed by Agis.</p>

<p>In the preceding argument respecting the redivision of land
ascribed to Lykurgus, I have taken that measure as it is described by
Plutarch. But there has been a tendency, in some able modern writers,
while admitting the general fact of such redivision, to reject the
account given by Plutarch in some of its main circumstances. That,
for instance, which is the capital feature in Plutarch’s narrative,
and which gives soul and meaning to his picture of the lawgiver—the
equality of partition—is now rejected by many as incorrect, and
it is supposed that Lykurgus made some new agrarian regulations
tending towards a general equality of landed property, but not an
entirely new partition; that he may have resumed from the wealthy
men lands which they had unjustly taken from the conquered Achæans,
and thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[p. 402]</span>
provided allotments both for the poorer citizens and for the subject
Laconians. Such is the opinion of Dr. Thirlwall, who at the same
time admits that the exact proportion of the Lykurgean distribution
can hardly be ascertained.<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700"
class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

<p>I cannot but take a different view of the statement made by
Plutarch. The moment that we depart from that rule of equality,
which stands so prominently marked in his biography of Lykur<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[p. 403]</span>gus, we step into
a boundless field of possibility, in which there is nothing to
determine us to one point more than to another. The surmise started
by Dr. Thirlwall, of lands unjustly taken from the conquered
Achæans by wealthy Spartan proprietors, is altogether gratuitous;
and granting it to be correct, we have still to explain how it
happened that this correction of a partial injustice came to be
transformed into the comprehensive and systematic measure which
Plutarch describes; and to explain, farther, from whence it arose
that none of the authors earlier than Plutarch take any notice of
Lykurgus as an agrarian equalizer. These two difficulties will still
remain, even if we overlook the gratuitous nature of Dr. Thirlwall’s
supposition, or of any other supposition which can be proposed
respecting the real Lykurgean measure which Plutarch is affirmed to
have misrepresented.</p>

<p>It appears to me that these difficulties are best obviated by
adopting a different canon of historical interpretation. We cannot
accept as real the Lykurgean land division described in the life
of the lawgiver; but treating this account as a fiction, two modes
of proceeding are open to us. We may either consider the fiction,
as it now stands, to be the exaggeration and distortion of some
small fact, and then try to guess, without any assistance, what
the small fact was. Or we may regard it as fiction from first to
last, the expression of some large idea and sentiment so powerful
in its action on men’s minds at a given time, as to induce them to
make a place for it among the realities of the past. Now the latter
supposition, applied to the times of Agis the Third, best meets
the case before us. The eighth chapter of the life of Lykurgus by
Plutarch, in recounting the partition of land, describes the dream
of king Agis, whose mind is full of two sentiments,—grief and shame
for the actual condition of his country,—together with reverence
for its past glories, as well as for the lawgiver from whose
institutions those glories had emanated. Absorbed with this double
feeling, the reveries of Agis go back to the old ante-Lykurgean
Sparta, as it stood more than five centuries before. He sees, in the
spirit, the same mischiefs and disorders as those which afflict his
waking eye,—gross inequalities of property, with a few insolent and
luxurious rich, a crowd of mutinous and suffering poor, and nothing
but fierce antipathy reigning between the two. Into the midst of this
fro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[p. 404]</span>ward, lawless,
and distempered community, steps the venerable missionary from
Delphi,—breathes into men’s minds new impulses, and an impatience
to shake off the old social and political Adam,—and persuades the
rich, voluntarily abnegating their temporal advantages, to welcome
with satisfaction a new system, wherein no distinction shall be
recognized, except that of good or evil desert.<a id="FNanchor_701"
href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> Having thus
regenerated the national mind, he parcels out the territory of
Laconia into equal lots, leaving no superiority to any one. Fraternal
harmony becomes the reigning sentiment, while the coming harvests
present the gratifying spectacle of a paternal inheritance recently
distributed, with the brotherhood contented, modest, and docile.
Such is the picture with which “mischievous Oneirus” cheats the
fancy of the patriotic Agis, whispering the treacherous message that
the gods have promised <i>him</i> success in a similar attempt, and thus
seducing him into that fatal revolutionary course, which is destined
to bring himself, his wife, and his aged mother, to the dungeon
and the hangman’s rope.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702"
class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p>That the golden dream just described was dreamed by some Spartan
patriots is certain, because it stands recorded in Plutarch; that it
was not dreamed by the authors of centuries preceding Agis, I have
already endeavored to show; that the earnest feelings, of sickness
of the present and yearning for a better future under the colors
of a restored past, which filled the soul of this king and his
brother-reformers,—combined with the levelling tendency between rich
and poor which really was inherent in the Lykurgean discipline,—were
amply sufficient to beget such a dream, and to procure for it a
place among the great deeds of the old lawgiver, so much venerated
and so little known,—this too I hold to be unquestionable. Had
there been any evidence that Lykurgus had interfered with private
property, to the limited extent which Dr. Thirlwall and other able
critics imagine,—that he had resumed certain lands unjustly taken by
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[p. 405]</span> rich from the
Achæans,—I should have been glad to record it; but, finding no such
evidence, I cannot think it necessary to presume the fact, simply
in order to account for the story in Plutarch.<a id="FNanchor_703"
href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>The various items in that story all hang together, and
must be understood as forming parts of the same comprehensive
fact, or comprehensive fancy. The fixed total of nine thousand
Spartan, and thirty thousand Laconian lots,<a id="FNanchor_704"
href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> the equality
between them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[p. 406]</span>
and the rent accruing from each, represented by a given quantity
of moist and dry produce,—all these particulars are alike true
or alike uncertified. Upon the various numbers here given, many
authors have raised calculations as to the population and produce of
Laconia, which appear to me destitute of any trustworthy foundation.
Those who accept the history, that Lykurgus constituted the
above-mentioned numbers both of citizens and of lots of land, and
that he contemplated the maintenance of both numbers in unchangeable
proportion,—are perplexed to assign the means whereby this adjustment
was kept undisturbed. Nor are they much assisted in the solution of
this embarrassing problem by the statement of Plutarch, who tells us
that the number remained fixed of itself, and that the succession ran
on from father to son, without either consolidation or multiplication
of parcels, down to the period when foreign wealth flowed into
Sparta, as a consequence of the successful conclusion of the
Peloponnesian war. Shortly after that period (he tells us) a citizen
named Epitadeus became ephor,—a vindictive and malignant man, who,
having had a quarrel with his son, and wishing to oust him from the
succession, introduced and obtained sanction to a new Rhetra, whereby
power was granted to every father of a family either to make over
during life, or to bequeathe after death, his house and his estate
to any one whom he chose.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705"
class="fnanchor">[705]</a> But it is plain that this story (whatever
be the truth about the family quarrel of Epitadeus) does not help
us out of the difficulty. From the time of Lykurgus to that of this
disinheriting ephor, more than four centuries must be reckoned: now,
had there been real causes at work sufficient to maintain inviolate
the identical number of lots and families during this long period, we
see no reason why his new law, simply permissive and nothing more,
should have overthrown it. We are not told by Plutarch what was
the law of succession prior to Epitadeus. If the whole estate went
by law to one son in the family, what became of the other sons, to
whom industrious acquisition in any shape was repulsive as well as
interdicted? If, on the other hand, the estate was divided be<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[p. 407]</span>tween the sons equally
(as it was by the law of succession at Athens), how can we defend the
maintenance of an unchanged aggregate number of parcels?</p>

<p>Dr. Thirlwall, after having admitted a modified interference
with private property by Lykurgus, so as to exact from the wealthy
a certain sacrifice in order to create lots for the poor, and to
bring about something approaching to equi-producing lots for all,
observes: “The average amount of the rent, paid by the cultivating
Helots from each lot, seems to have been no more than was required
for the frugal maintenance of a family with six persons. The right of
transfer was as strictly confined as that of enjoyment; the patrimony
was indivisible, inalienable, and descended to the eldest son; in
default of a male heir, to the eldest daughter. The object seems to
have been, after the number of the allotments became fixed, that
each should be constantly represented by one head of a household.
But the nature of the means employed for this end is one of the
most obscure points of the Spartan system.... In the better times
of the commonwealth, this seems to have been principally effected
by adoptions and marriages with heiresses, which provided for the
marriages of younger sons in families too numerous to be supported on
their own hereditary property. It was then probably seldom necessary
for the state to interfere, in order to direct the childless owner
of an estate, or the father of a rich heiress, to a proper choice.
But as all adoption required the sanction of the kings, and they
had also the disposal of the hand of orphan heiresses, there can be
little doubt that the magistrate had the power of interposing on
such occasions, even in opposition to the wishes of individuals, to
relieve poverty and check the accumulation of wealth.” (Hist. Gr. ch.
8, vol. i. p. 367).</p>

<p>I cannot concur in the view which Dr. Thirlwall here takes of the
state of property, or the arrangements respecting its transmission,
in ancient Sparta. Neither the equal modesty of possession which
he supposes, nor the precautions for perpetuating it, can be shown
to have ever existed among the pupils of Lykurgus. Our earliest
information intimates the existence of rich men at Sparta: the
story of king Aristo and Agêtus, in Herodotus, exhibits to us
the latter as a man who cannot be supposed to have had only just
“enough to maintain six persons frugally,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_408">[p. 408]</span>”—while his beautiful wife, whom Aristo
coveted and entrapped from him, is expressly described as the
daughter of opulent parents. Sperthiês and Bulis, the Talthybiads,
are designated as belonging to a distinguished race, and among the
wealthiest men in Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706"
class="fnanchor">[706]</a> Demaratus was the only king of Sparta,
in the days of Herodotus, who had ever gained a chariot-victory
in the Olympic games; but we know by the case of Lichas, during
the Peloponnesian war, Evagoras, and others, that private Spartans
were equally successful;<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707"
class="fnanchor">[707]</a> and for one Spartan who won the prize,
there must of course have been many who bred their horses and
started their chariots unsuccessfully. It need hardly be remarked,
that chariot-competition at Olympia was one of the most significant
evidences of a wealthy house: nor were there wanting Spartans who
kept horses and dogs without any exclusive view to the games. We
know from Xenophon that, at the time of the battle of Leuktra,
“the very rich Spartans” provided the horses to be mounted for
the state-cavalry.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708"
class="fnanchor">[708]</a> These and other proofs, of the existence
of rich men at Sparta, are inconsistent with the idea of a body
of citizens each possessing what was about enough for the frugal
maintenance of six persons, and no more.</p>

<p>As we do not find that such was in practice the state of
property in the Spartan community, so neither can we discover that
the lawgiver ever tried either to make or to keep it so. What
he did was to impose a rigorous public discipline, with simple
clothing and fare, incumbent alike upon the rich and the poor (this
was his special present to Greece, according to Thucydidês,<a
id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
and his great point of contact with democracy, according to
Aristotle); but he took no pains either to restrain the enrichment
of the former, or to prevent the impoverishment of the latter. He
meddled little with the distribution of property, and such neglect
is one of the capital deficiencies for which Aristotle censures
him. That philosopher tells us, indeed, that the Spartan law had
made it dishonorable (he does not say, peremptorily forbidden) to
buy or sell landed property, but that there was the fullest liberty
both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[p. 409]</span> of donation
and bequest: and the same results, he justly observes, ensued from
the practice tolerated as would have ensued from the practice
discountenanced,—since it was easy to disguise a real sale under an
ostensible donation. He notices pointedly the tendency of property
at Sparta to concentrate itself in fewer hands, unopposed by any
legal hindrances: the fathers married their daughters to whomsoever
they chose, and gave dowries according to their own discretion,
generally very large: the rich families, moreover, intermarried
among one another habitually, and without restriction. Now all
these are indicated by Aristotle as cases in which the law might
have interfered, and ought to have interfered, but did not,—for the
great purpose of disseminating the benefits of landed property as
much as possible among the mass of the citizens. Again, he tells us
that the law encouraged the multiplication of progeny, and granted
exemptions to such citizens as had three or four children,—but
took no thought how the numerous families of poorer citizens were
to live, or to maintain their qualification at the public tables,
most of the lands of the state being in the hands of the rich.<a
id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
His notice, and condemnation, of that law, which made the franchise
of the Spartan citizen dependent upon his continuing to furnish his
quota to the public table,—has been already adverted to; as well as
the potent love of money<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711"
class="fnanchor">[711]</a> which he notes in the Spartan character,
and which must have tended continually to keep together the richer
families among themselves: while amongst a community where industry
was unknown, no poor citizen could ever become rich.</p>

<p>If we duly weigh these evidences, we shall see that equality
of possessions neither existed in fact, nor ever entered into the
scheme and tendencies of the lawgiver at Sparta. And the picture
which Dr. Thirlwall<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712"
class="fnanchor">[712]</a> has drawn of a body of citizens each<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[p. 410]</span> possessing a lot of
land about adequate to the frugal maintenance of six persons,—of
adoptions and marriages of heiresses arranged<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_411">[p. 411]</span> with a deliberate view of providing
for the younger children of numerous families,—of interference on
the part of the kings to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[p.
412]</span> insure this object,—of a fixed number of lots of land,
each represented by one head of a household,—this picture is one,
of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[p. 413]</span>
the reality must not be sought on the banks of the Eurotas. The
“better times of the commonwealth,” to which he refers,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[p. 414]</span> may have existed in the
glowing retrospect of Agis, but are not acknowledged in the sober
appreciation of Aristotle. That the citizens were far more numerous
in early times, the philosopher tells us, and that the community had
in his day greatly declined in power, we also know: in this sense,
the times of Sparta had doubtless once been better. We may even
concede that during the three centuries succeeding Lykurgus, when
they were continually acquiring new territory, and when Aristotle had
been told that they had occasionally admitted new citizens, so that
the aggregate number of citizens had once been ten thousand,—we may
concede that in these previous centuries the distribution of land had
been less unequal, so that the disproportion between the great size
of the territory and the small number of citizens was not so marked
as it had become at the period which the philosopher personally
witnessed; for the causes tending to augmented inequality were
constant and uninterrupted in their working. But this admission will
still leave us far removed from the sketch drawn by Dr. Thirlwall,
which depicts the Lykurgean Sparta as starting from a new agrarian
scheme not far removed from equality of landed property,—the citizens
as spontaneously disposed to uphold this equality, by giving to
unprovided men the benefit of adoptions and heiress-marriages,—and
the magistrate as interfering to enforce this latter purpose, even
in cases where the citizens were themselves unwilling. All our
evidence exhibits to us both decided inequality of possessions and
inclinations on the part of rich men, the reverse of those which
Dr. Thirlwall indicates; nor will the powers of interference which
he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[p. 415]</span> ascribes to
the magistrate be found sustained by the chapter of Herodotus on
which he seems to rest them.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713"
class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[p. 416]</span>To conceive
correctly, then, the Lykurgean system, as far as obscurity and want
of evidence will permit, it seems to me that there are two current
misconceptions which it is essential to discard. One of these is,
that the system included a repartition of landed property, upon
principles of exact or approximative equality (distinct from that
appropriation which belonged to the Dorian conquest and settlement),
and provisions for perpetuating the number of distinct and equal
lots. The other is, that it was first brought to bear when the
Spartans were masters of all Laconia. The illusions created by
the old legend,—which depicts Laconia as all one country, and all
conquered at one stroke,—yet survive after the legend itself has been
set aside as bad evidence: we cannot conceive Sparta as subsisting
by itself without dominion over Laconia; nor Amyklæ, Pharis, and
Geronthræ, as really and truly independent of Sparta. Yet, if these
towns were independent in the time of Lykurgus, much more confidently
may the same independence be affirmed of the portions of Laconia
which lie lower than Amyklæ down the valley of the Eurotas, as well
as of the eastern coast, which Herodotus expressly states to have
been originally connected with Argos.</p>

<p>Discarding, then, these two suppositions, we have to consider the
Lykurgean system as brought to bear upon Sparta and its immediate
circumjacent district, apart from the rest of Laconia, and as not
meddling systematically with the partition of property, whatever
that may have been, which the Dorian conquerors established at their
original settlement. Lykurgus does not try to make the poor rich, nor
the rich poor; but he imposes upon both the same subjugating drill,<a
id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>—the
same habits of life, gentlemanlike idleness, and unlettered
strength,—the same fare, clothing, labors, privations, endurance,
punishments, and subordination. It is a lesson instructive at
least, however unsatisfactory, to political students,—that, with
all this equality of dealing, he ends in creating a community in
whom not merely the love of preëminence, but even the love of money,
stands powerfully and specially developed.<a id="FNanchor_715"
href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[p. 417]</span>How far
the peculiar of the primitive Sparta extended we have no means of
determining; but its limits down the valley of the Eurotas were
certainly narrow, inasmuch as it did not reach so far as Amyklæ.
Nor can we tell what principles the Dorian conquerors may have
followed in the original allotment of lands within the limits of
that peculiar. Equal apportionment is not probable, because all the
individuals of a conquering band are seldom regarded as possessing
equal claims; but whatever the original apportionment may have
been, it remained without any general or avowed disturbance until
the days of Agis the Third, and Kleomenês the Third. Here, then,
we have the primitive Sparta, including Dorian warriors with their
Helot subjects, but no Periœki. And it is upon these Spartans
separately, perhaps after the period of aggravated disorder and
lawlessness noticed by Herodotus and Thucydidês, that the painful but
invigorating discipline, above sketched, must have been originally
brought to bear.</p>

<p>The gradual conquest of Laconia, with the acquisition of
additional lands and new Helots, and the formation of the order
of Periœki, both of which were a consequence of it,—is to be
considered as posterior to the introduction of the Lykurgean system
at Sparta, and as resulting partly from the increased force which
that system imparted. The career of conquest went on, beginning
from Têleklus, for nearly three centuries,—with some interruptions,
indeed, and in the case of the Messenian war, with a desperate and
even precarious struggle,—so that in the time of Thucydidês, and
for some time previously, the Spartans possessed two-fifths of
Peloponnesus. And this series of new acquisitions and victories
disguised the really weak point of the Spartan system, by rendering
it possible either to plant the poorer citizens as Periœki in a
conquered township, or to supply them with lots of land, of which
they could receive the produce without leaving the city,—so that
their numbers and their military strength were prevented from
declining. It is even affirmed by Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_716"
href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> that during these
early times they augmented the numbers of their citizens by fresh
admissions, which of course implies the acquisition of additional
lots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[p. 418]</span> land.
But successful war, to use an expression substantially borrowed
from the same philosopher, was necessary to their salvation: the
establishment of their ascendency, and of their maximum of territory,
was followed, after no very long interval, by symptoms of decline.<a
id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
It will hereafter be seen that, at the period of the conspiracy
of Kinadôn (395 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), the full citizens (called
Homoioi, or Peers) were considerably inferior in number to the
Hypomeiŏnes, or Spartans, who could no longer furnish their
qualification, and had become disfranchised. And the loss thus
sustained was very imperfectly repaired by the admitted practice,
sometimes resorted to by rich men, of associating with their own
children the children of poorer citizens, and paying the contribution
for these latter to the public tables, so as to enable them to go
through the prescribed course of education and discipline,—whereby
they became (under the title or sobriquet of Mothăkes<a
id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>)
citizens, with a certain taint of inferiority, yet were sometimes
appointed to honorable commands.</p>

<p>Laconia, the state and territory of the Lacedæmonians, was
affirmed, at the time of its greatest extension, to have comprehended
a hundred cities,<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719"
class="fnanchor">[719]</a>—this after the conquest of Messenia;<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[p. 419]</span> so that it would
include all the southern portion of Peloponnesus, from Thyrea, on
the Argolic gulf, to the southern bank of the river Nedon, in its
course into the Ionian sea. But Laconia, more strictly so called,
was distinguished from Messenia, and was understood to designate the
portion of the above-mentioned territory which lay to the east of
Mount Taygetus. The conquest of Messenia by the Spartans we shall
presently touch upon; but that of Laconia proper is very imperfectly
narrated to us. Down to the reign of Têleklus, as has been before
remarked, Amyklæ, Pharis, and Geronthræ, were still Achæan: in the
reign of that prince they were first conquered, and the Achæans
either expelled or subjugated. It cannot be doubted that Amyklæ
had been previously a place of consequence: in point of heroic
antiquity and memorials, this city, as well as Therapnæ, seems to
have surpassed Sparta. And the war of the Spartans against it is
represented as a struggle of some moment,—indeed, in those times, the
capture of any walled city was tedious and difficult. Timomachus,
an Ægeid from Thebes,<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720"
class="fnanchor">[720]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[p.
420]</span> at the head of a body of his countrymen, is said to
have rendered essential service to the Spartans in the conquest of
the Achæans of Amyklæ; and the brave resistance of the latter was
commemorated by a monument erected to Zeus Tropæus, at Sparta, which
was still to be seen in the time of Pausanias.<a id="FNanchor_721"
href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> The Achæans of Pharis
and Geronthræ, alarmed by the fate of Amyklæ, are said to have
surrendered their towns with little or no resistance: after which
the inhabitants of all the three cities, either wholly or in part,
went into exile beyond sea, giving place to colonists from Sparta.<a
id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>
From this time forward, according to Pausanias, Amyklæ continued
as a village.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723"
class="fnanchor">[723]</a> But as the Amyklæan hoplites constituted
a valuable portion of the Spartan army, it must have been numbered
among the cities of the Periœki, as one of the hundred;<a
id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> the
distinction between a dependent city and a village not being very
strictly drawn. The festival of the Hyacinthia, celebrated at the
great temple of the Amyklæan Apollo, was among the most solemn and
venerated in the Spartan calendar.</p>

<p>It was in the time of Alkamenês, the son of Têleklus, that the
Spartans conquered Helus, a maritime town on the left bank of the
Eurotas, and reduced its inhabitants to bondage,—from whose name,<a
id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>
according to various authors, the general title <i>Helots</i>, belonging
to all the serfs of Laconia, was derived. But of the conquest of the
other towns of Laconia,—Gytheium, Akriæ, Therapnæ, etc.,—or of the
eastern land on the coast of the Argolic gulf, including Brasiæ and
Epidaurus Limêra, or the island of Kythêra, all which at one time
belonged to the Argeian confederacy, we have no accounts.</p>

<p>Scanty as our information is, it just enables us to make out
a progressive increase of force and dominion on the part of the
Spartans, resulting from the organization of Lykurgus. Of this<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[p. 421]</span> progress, a farther
manifestation is found, besides the conquest of the Achæans in the
south by Têleklus and Alkamenês, in their successful opposition
to the great power of Pheidôn the Argeian, related in a previous
chapter. We now approach the long and arduous efforts by which
they accomplished the subjugation of their brethren the Messenian
Dorians.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />
    FIRST AND SECOND MESSENIAN WARS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">That</span> there were two long
contests between the Lacedæmonians and Messenians, and that in
both the former were completely victorious, is a fact sufficiently
attested. And if we could trust the statements in Pausanias,—our
chief and almost only authority on the subject,—we should be in a
situation to recount the history of both these wars in considerable
detail. But unfortunately, the incidents narrated in that writer have
been gathered from sources which are, even by his own admission,
undeserving of credit,—from Rhianus, the poet of Bênê in Krete, who
had composed an epic poem on Aristomenês and the second Messenian
war, about <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 220,—and from Myrôn of Priênê,
a prose author whose date is not exactly known, but belonging
to the Alexandrine age, and not earlier than the third century
before the Christian era. From Rhianus, we have no right to expect
trustworthy information, while the accuracy of Myrôn is much
depreciated by Pausanias himself,—on some points even too much, as
will presently be shown. But apart from the mental habits either
of the prose writer or the poet, it does not seem that any good
means of knowledge were open to either of them, except the poems of
Tyrtæus, which we are by no means sure that they ever consulted.
The account of the two wars, extracted from these two authors by
Pausanias, is a string of <i>tableaux</i>, several of them, indeed, highly
poetical, but destitute of historical coher<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_422">[p. 422]</span>ence or sufficiency: and O. Müller has
justly observed, that “absolutely no reason is given in them for the
subjection of Messenia.”<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726"
class="fnanchor">[726]</a> They are accounts unworthy of being
transcribed in detail into the pages of genuine history, nor can we
pretend to do anything more than verify a few leading facts of the
war.</p>

<p>The poet Tyrtæus was himself engaged on the side of the Spartans
in the second war, and it is from him that we learn the few
indisputable facts respecting both the first and the second. If
the Messenians had never been reëstablished in Peloponnesus, we
should probably never have heard any farther details respecting
these early contests. That reëstablishment, together with the first
foundation of the city called Messênê on Mount Ithomê, was among
the capital wounds inflicted on Sparta by Epameinondas, in the year
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 369,—between three hundred and two hundred
and fifty years after the conclusion of the second Messenian war.
The descendants of the old Messenians, who had remained for so long
a period without any fixed position in Greece, were incorporated
in the new city, together with various Helots and miscellaneous
settlers who had no claim to a similar genealogy. The gods and heroes
of the Messenian race were reverentially invoked at this great
ceremony, especially the great hero Aristomenês;<a id="FNanchor_727"
href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> and the site of Mount
Ithomê, the ardor of the newly established citizens, the hatred and
apprehension of Sparta, operating as a powerful stimulus to the
creation and multiplication of what are called <i>traditions</i>, sufficed
to expand the few facts known respecting the struggles of the old
Messenians into a variety of details. In almost all these stories we
discover a coloring unfavorable to Sparta, contrasting forcibly with
the account given by Isokratês, in his Discourse called Archidamus,
wherein we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[p. 423]</span> read
the view which a Spartan might take of the ancient conquests of his
forefathers. But a clear proof that these Messenian stories had no
real basis of tradition, is shown in the contradictory statements
respecting the principal Hero Aristomenês; for some place him in the
first, others in the second, of the two wars. Diodôrus and Myrôn both
placed him in the first; Rhianus, in the second. Though Pausanias
gives it as his opinion that the account of the latter is preferable,
and that Aristomenês really belongs to the second Messenian war,
it appears to me that the one statement is as much worthy of
belief as the other, and that there is no sufficient evidence for
deciding between them,—a conclusion which is substantially the same
with that of Wesseling, who thinks that there were two persons
named Aristomenês, one in the first and one in the second war.<a
id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>
This inextricable confusion respecting the greatest name in Messenian
antiquity, shows how little any genuine stream of tradition can here
be recognized.</p>

<p>Pausanias states the first Messenian war as beginning in
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 743 and lasting till <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
724,—the second, as beginning in <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 685 and lasting
till <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 668. Neither of these dates rest upon<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[p. 424]</span> any assignable
positive authority; but the time assigned to the first war seems
probable, while that of the second is apparently too early. Tyrtæus
authenticates both the duration of the first war, twenty years, and
the eminent services rendered in it by the Spartan king Theopompus.<a
id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>
He says, moreover, speaking during the second war, “the fathers of
our fathers conquered Messênê;” thus loosely indicating the relative
dates of the two.</p>

<p>The Spartans (as we learn from Isokratês, whose words date from a
time when the city of Messênê was only a recent foundation) professed
to have seized the territory, partly in revenge for the impiety of
the Messenians in killing their own king, the Herakleid Kresphontês,
whose relative had appealed to Sparta for aid,—partly by sentence
of the Delphian oracle. Such were the causes which had induced them
first to invade the country, and they had conquered it after a
struggle of twenty years.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730"
class="fnanchor">[730]</a> The Lacedæmonian explanations, as given in
Pausanias, seem for the most part to be counter-statements arranged
after the time when the Messenian version, evidently the interesting
and popular account, had become circulated.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that the Lacedæmonians and Messenians
had a joint border temple and sacrifice in honor of Artemis
Limnatis, dating from the earliest times of their establishment
in Peloponnesus. The site of this temple, near the upper course
of the river Nedon, in the mountainous territory north-east of
Kalamata, but west of the highest ridge of Taygetus, has recently
been exactly verified,—and it seems in these early days<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[p. 425]</span> to have belonged to
Sparta. That the quarrel began at one of these border sacrifices
was the statement of both parties, Lacedæmonians and Messenians.
According to the latter, the Lacedæmonian king Têleklus laid a
snare for the Messenians, by dressing up some youthful Spartans as
virgins, and giving them daggers; whereupon a contest ensued, in
which the Spartans were worsted and Têleklus slain. That Têleklus
was slain at the temple by the Messenians, was also the account of
the Spartans,—but they affirmed that he was slain in attempting to
defend some young Lacedæmonian maidens, who were sacrificing at the
temple, against outrageous violence from the Messenian youth.<a
id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> In
spite of the death of this king, however, the war did not actually
break out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[p. 426]</span> until
some little time after, when Alkamenês and Theopompus were kings
at Sparta, and Antiochus and Androklês, sons of Phintas, kings
of Messenia. The immediate cause of it was a private altercation
between the Messenian Polycharês (victor at the fourth Olympiad,
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 764) and the Spartan Euæphnus. Polycharês,
having been grossly injured by Euæphnus, and his claim for redress
having been rejected at Sparta, took revenge by aggressions upon
other Lacedæmonians; the Messenians refused to give him up, though
one of the two kings, Androklês, strongly insisted upon doing so,
and maintained his opinion so earnestly against the opposite sense
of the majority and of his brother Antiochus, that a tumult arose,
and he was slain. The Lacedæmonians, now resolving upon war, struck
the first blow without any formal declaration, by surprising the
border town of Ampheia, and putting its defenders to the sword.
They farther overran the Messenian territory, and attacked some
other towns, but without success. Euphaês, who had now succeeded
his father Antiochus as king of Messenia, summoned the forces of
the country and carried on the war against them with energy and
boldness. For the first four years of the war, the Lacedæmonians made
no progress, and even incurred the ridicule of the old men of their
nation as faint-hearted warriors: in the fifth year, however, they
undertook a more vigorous invasion, under their two kings, Theopompus
and Polydôrus, who were met by Euphaês with the full force of the
Messenians. A desperate battle ensued, in which it does not seem
that either side gained much advantage: nevertheless, the Messenians
found themselves so much enfeebled by it, that they were forced to
take refuge on the fortified mountain of Ithômê, abandoning the rest
of the country. In their distress, they sent to solicit counsel
and protection from Delphi, but their messenger brought back the
appalling answer that a virgin, of the royal race of Æpytus, must be
sacrificed for their salvation: in the tragic scene which ensues,
Aristodêmus puts to death his own daughter, yet without satisfying
the exigencies of the oracle. The war still continued, and in the
thirteenth year of it another hard-fought battle took place, in which
the brave Euphaês was slain, but the result was again indecisive.
Aristodêmus, being elected king in his place, prosecuted the war
strenuously: the fifth year of his reign is signalized by a third
general battle, wherein the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[p.
427]</span> Corinthians assist the Spartans, and the Arcadians and
Sikyonians are on the side of Messenia; the victory is here decisive
on the side of Aristodêmus, and the Lacedæmonians are driven, back
into their own territory.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732"
class="fnanchor">[732]</a> It was now their turn to send envoys and
ask advice from the Delphian oracle; while the remaining events
of the war exhibit a series, partly of stratagems to fulfil the
injunctions of the priestess,—partly of prodigies in which the divine
wrath is manifested against the Messenians. The king Aristodêmus,
agonized with the thought that he has slain his own daughter without
saving his country, puts an end to his own life.<a id="FNanchor_733"
href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> In the twentieth year
of the war, the Messenians abandoned Ithômê, which the Lacedæmonians
razed to the ground: the rest of the country being speedily
conquered, such of the inhabitants as did not flee either to Arcadia
or to Eleusis, were reduced to complete submission.</p>

<p>Such is the abridgment of what Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_734"
href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> gives as the
narrative of the first Messenian war. Most of his details bear the
evident stamp of mere late romance; and it will easily be seen
that the sequence of events presents no plausible explanation of
that which is really indubitable,—the result. The twenty years’
war, and the final abandonment of Ithômê, is attested by Tyrtæus
beyond all doubt, as well as the harsh treatment of the conquered.
“Like asses, worn down by heavy burdens,”<a id="FNanchor_735"
href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> says the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[p. 428]</span> Spartan poet, “they
were compelled to make over to their masters an entire half of the
produce of their fields, and to come in the garb of woe to Sparta,
themselves and their wives, as mourners at the decease of the kings
and principal persons.” The revolt of their descendants, against a
yoke so oppressive, goes by the name of the second Messenian war.</p>

<p>Had we possessed the account of the first Messenian war as given
by Myrôn and Diodorus, it would evidently have been very different
from the above, because they included Aristomenês in it, and to
him the leading parts would be assigned. As the narrative now
stands in Pausanias, we are not introduced to that great Messenian
hero,—the Achilles of the epic of Rhianus,<a id="FNanchor_736"
href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>—until the second
war, in which his gigantic proportions stand prominently forward.
He is the great champion of his country in the three battles which
are represented as taking place during this war: the first, with
indecisive result, at Deræ; the second, a signal victory on the part
of the Messenians, at the Boar’s Grave; the third, an equally signal
defeat, in consequence of the traitorous flight of Aristokratês,
king of the Arcadian Orchomenus, who, ostensibly embracing the
alliance of the Messenians, had received bribes from Sparta.
Thrice did Aristomenês sacrifice to Zeus Ithomatês the sacrifice
called Hekatomphonia,<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737"
class="fnanchor">[737]</a> reserved for those who had slain with
their own hands a hundred enemies in battle. At the head of a chosen
band, he carried his incursions more than once into the heart of
the Lacedæmonian territory, surprised Amyklæ and Pharis, and even
penetrated by night into the unfortified precinct of Sparta itself,
where he suspended his shield, as a token of defiance, in the temple
of Athênê Chalkiœkus. Thrice was he taken prisoner, but on two
occasions marvellously escaped before he could be conveyed to Sparta:
the third occasion was more fatal, and he was cast by order of the
Spartans into the Keadas, a deep, rocky cavity in Mount Taygetus,
into which it was their habit to precipitate criminals. But even in
this emergency the divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[p.
429]</span> aid<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738"
class="fnanchor">[738]</a> was not withheld from him. While the fifty
Messenians who shared his punishment, were all killed by the shock,
he alone was both supported by the gods so as to reach the bottom
unhurt, and enabled to find an unexpected means of escape. For when,
abandoning all hope, he had wrapped himself up in his cloak to die,
he perceived a fox creeping about among the dead bodies: waiting
until the animal approached him, he grasped its tail, defending
himself from its bites as well as he could by means of his cloak;
and being thus enabled to find the aperture by which the fox had
entered, enlarged it sufficiently for crawling out himself. To the
surprise both of friends and enemies, he again appeared, alive and
vigorous, at Eira. That fortified mountain on the banks of the river
Nedon, and near the Ionian sea, had been occupied by the Messenians,
after the battle in which they had been betrayed by Aristokratês,
the Arcadian; it was there that they had concentrated their whole
force, as in the former war at Ithômê, abandoning the rest of the
country. Under the conduct of Aristomenês, assisted by the prophet
Theoklus, they maintained this strong position for eleven years. At
length, they were compelled to abandon it; but, as in the case of
Ithômê, the final determining circumstances are represented to have
been, not any superiority of bravery or organization on the part of
the Lacedæmonians, but treacherous betrayal and stratagem, seconding
the fatal decree of the gods. Unable to maintain Eira longer,
Aristomenês, with his sons, and a body of his countrymen, forced his
way through the assailants, and quitted the country,—some of them
retiring to Arcadia and Elis, and finally migrating to Rhegium. He
himself passed the remainder of his days in Rhodes, where he dwelt
along with his son-in-law, Damagêtus, the ancestor of the noble
Rhodian family, called the Diagorids, celebrated for its numerous
Olympic victories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[p. 430]</span>Such are
the main features of what Pausanias calls<a id="FNanchor_739"
href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> the second Messenian
war, or of what ought rather to be called the Aristomeneïs of the
poet Rhianus. That after the foundation of Messênê, and the recall
of the exiles by Epameinondas. favor and credence was found for many
tales respecting the prowess of the ancient hero whom they invoked<a
id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>
in their libations,—tales well calculated to interest the fancy, to
vivify the patriotism, and to inflame the anti-Spartan antipathies,
of the new inhabitants,—there can be little doubt. And the
Messenian maidens of that day may well have sung, in their public
processional sacrifices,<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741"
class="fnanchor">[741]</a> how “Aristomenês pursued the flying
Lacedæmonians down to the mid-plain of Stenyklêrus, and up to the
very summit of the mountain.” From such stories, <i>traditions</i> they
ought not to be denominated, Rhianus may doubtless have borrowed;
but if proof were wanting to show how completely he looked at his
materials from the point of view of the poet, and not from that of
the historian, we should find it in the remarkable fact noticed by
Pausanias. Rhianus represented Leotychides as having been king of
Sparta during the second Messenian war; now Leotychides, as Pausanias
observes, did not reign until near a century and a half afterwards,
during the Persian invasion.<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742"
class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[p. 431]</span>To the great
champion of Messenia, during this war, we may oppose, on the side
of Sparta, another remarkable person, less striking as a character
of romance, but more interesting, in many ways, to the historian,—I
mean, the poet Tyrtæus, a native of Aphidnæ in Attica, an inestimable
ally of the Lacedæmonians during most part of this second struggle.
According to a story,—which, however, has the air partly of a boast
of the later Attic orators,—the Spartans, disheartened at the
first successes of the Messenians, consulted the Delphian oracle,
and were directed to ask for a leader from Athens. The Athenians
complied by sending Tyrtæus, whom Pausanias and Justin represent as
a lame man and a schoolmaster, despatched with a view of nominally
obeying the oracle, and yet rendering no real assistance.<a
id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
This seems to be a coloring put upon the story by later writers,
but the intervention of the Athenians in the matter, in any way,
deserves little credit.<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744"
class="fnanchor">[744]</a> It seems more probable that the legendary
connection of the Dioskuri with Aphidnæ, celebrated at or near
that time by the poet Alkman, brought about, through the Delphian
oracle, the presence of the Aphidnæan poet at Sparta. Respecting
the lameness of Tyrtæus, we can say nothing: but that he was a
schoolmaster (if we are constrained to employ an unsuitable term)
is highly probable,—for in that day, minstrels, who composed and
sung poems, were the only persons from whom the youth received any
men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[p. 432]</span>tal training.
Moreover, his sway over the youthful mind is particularly noted in
the compliment paid to him, in after-days, by king Leonidas: “Tyrtæus
was an adept in tickling the souls of youth.”<a id="FNanchor_745"
href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> We see enough
to satisfy us that he was by birth a stranger, though he became
a Spartan by the subsequent recompense of citizenship conferred
upon him,—that he was sent through the Delphian oracle,—that he
was an impressive and efficacious minstrel, and that he had,
moreover, sagacity enough to employ his talents for present
purposes and diverse needs; being able, not merely to reanimate the
languishing courage of the baffled warrior, but also to soothe the
discontents of the mutinous. That his strains, which long maintained
undiminished popularity among the Spartans,<a id="FNanchor_746"
href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> contributed much
to determine the ultimate issue of this war, there is no reason to
doubt; nor is his name the only one to attest the susceptibility of
the Spartan mind in that day towards music and poetry. The first
establishment of the Karneian festival, with its musical competition,
at Sparta, falls during the period assigned by Pausanias to the
second Messenian war: the Lesbian harper, Terpander, who gained the
first recorded prize at this solemnity, is affirmed to have been
sent for by the Spartans pursuant to a mandate from the Delphian
oracle, and to have been the means of appeasing a sedition. In like
manner, the Kretan Thalêtas was invited thither during a pestilence,
which his art, as it is pretended, contributed to heal (about 620
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>); and Alkman, Xenokritus, Polymnastus, and
Sakadas, all foreigners by birth, found favorable reception, and
acquired popularity, by their music and poetry. With the exception
of Sakadas, who is a little later, all these names fall in the
same century as Tyrtæus, between 660 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>-610
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> The fashion which the Spartan music
continued for a long time to maintain, is ascribed chiefly to the
genius of Terpander.<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747"
class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

<p>The training in which a Spartan passed his life consisted of
exercises warlike, social, and religious, blended together. While
the individual, strengthened by gymnastics, went through his<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[p. 433]</span> painful lessons of
fatigue, endurance, and aggression,—the citizens collectively
were kept in the constant habit of simultaneous and regulated
movement in the warlike march, in the religious dance, and in the
social procession. Music and song, being constantly employed to
direct the measure and keep alive the spirit<a id="FNanchor_748"
href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> of these
multitudinous movements, became associated with the most powerful
feelings which the habitual self-suppression of a Spartan permitted
to arise, and especially with those sympathies which are communicated
at once to an assembled crowd; indeed, the musician and the minstrel
were the only persons who ever addressed themselves to the feelings
of a Lacedæmonian assembly. Moreover, the simple music of that early
day, though destitute of artistical merit, and superseded afterwards
by more complicated combinations, had, nevertheless, a pronounced
ethical character; it wrought much more powerfully on the impulses
and resolutions of the hearers, though it tickled the ear less
gratefully, than the scientific compositions of after-days. Farther,
each particular style of music had its own appropriate mental
effect,—the Phrygian mode imparted a wild and maddening stimulus;
the Dorian mode created a settled and deliberate resolution, exempt
alike from the desponding and from the impetuous sentiments.<a
id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>
What is called the Dorian mode, seems to be in reality the old
native Greek mode, as contradistinguished from the Phrygian and
Lydian,—these being the three primitive modes, subdivided and
combined only in later times, with which the first Grecian musicians
became conversant. It probably acquired its title of Dorian from
the musical celebrity of Sparta and Argos, during the seventh and
sixth centuries before the Christian era; but it belonged as much to
the Arcadians and Achæans as to the Spartans and Argeians. And the
marked ethical effects, produced both by the Dorian and the Phrygian
modes in ancient times, are facts perfectly well-attested, however
difficult they may be to explain upon any general theory of music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[p. 434]</span>That the
impression produced by Tyrtæus at Sparta, therefore, with his
martial music, and emphatic exhortations to bravery in the field,
as well as union at home, should have been very considerable, is
perfectly consistent with the character both of the age and of
the people; especially, as he is represented to have appeared
pursuant to the injunction of the Delphian oracle. From the scanty
fragments remaining to us of his elegies and anapæsts, however, we
can satisfy ourselves only of two facts: first, that the war was
long, obstinately contested, and dangerous to Sparta as well as
to the Messenians; next, that other parties in Peloponnesus took
part on both sides, especially on the side of the Messenians. So
frequent and harassing were the aggressions of the latter upon the
Spartan territory, that a large portion of the border land was left
uncultivated: scarcity ensued, and the proprietors of the deserted
farms, driven to despair, pressed for a redivision of the landed
property in the state. It was in appeasing these discontents that
the poem of Tyrtæus, called Eunomia, “Legal order,” was found
signally beneficial.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750"
class="fnanchor">[750]</a> It seems certain that a considerable
portion of the Arcadians, together with the Pisatæ and the
Triphylians, took part with the Messenians; there are also some
statements numbering the Eleians among their allies, but this appears
not probable. The state of the case rather seems to have been, that
the old quarrel between the Eleians and the Pisatæ, respecting the
right to preside at the Olympic games, which had already burst
forth during the preceding century, in the reign of the Argeian
Pheidôn, still continued. Unwilling dependents of Elis, the Pisatæ
and Triphylians took part with the subject Messenians, while the
masters at Elis and Sparta made common cause, as they had before
done against Pheidôn.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751"
class="fnanchor">[751]</a> Pantaleôn, king of Pisa, revolting from
Elis, acted as commander of his countrymen in coöperation with the
Messenians; and he is farther noted for having, at the period of
the 34th Olympiad (644 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), marched a body
of troops to Olympia, and thus dispossessed the Eleians, on that
occasion, of the presidency: that particular festival,—as well as the
8th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[p. 435]</span> Olympiad,
in which Pheidôn interfered,—and the 104th Olympiad, in which the
Arcadians marched in,—were always marked on the Eleian register as
non-Olympiads, or informal celebrations. We may reasonably connect
this temporary triumph of the Pisatans with the Messenian war,
inasmuch as they were no match for the Eleians single-handed, while
the fraternity of Sparta with Elis is in perfect harmony with the
scheme of Peloponnesian politics which we have observed as prevalent
even before and during the days of Pheidôn.<a id="FNanchor_752"
href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> The second<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[p. 436]</span> Messenian war will
thus stand as beginning somewhere about the 33d Olympiad, or 648
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, between seventy and eighty years after
the close of the first, and lasting, according to Pausanias,
seventeen years; according to Plutarch, more than twenty years.<a
id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[p. 437]</span>Many of the
Messenians who abandoned their country after this second conquest
are said to have found shelter and sympathy among the Arcadians,
who admitted them to a new home and gave them their daughters in
marriage; and who, moreover, punished severely the treason of
Aristokratês, king of Orchomenus, in abandoning the Messenians at the
battle of the Trench. That perfidious leader was put to death, and
his race dethroned, while the crime as well as the punishment was
farther commemorated by an inscription, which was to be seen near the
altar of Zeus Lykæus, in Arcadia. The inscription doubtless existed
in the days of Kallisthenês, in the generation after the restoration
of Messênê. But whether it had any existence prior to that event, or
what degree of truth there may be in the story of Aristokratês, we
are unable to determine:<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754"
class="fnanchor">[754]</a> the son of Aristokratês, named
Aristodêmus, is alleged in another authority to have reigned
afterwards at Orchomenus.<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755"
class="fnanchor">[755]</a> That which stands strongly marked is, the
sympathy of Arcadians and Messenians against Sparta,—a sentiment
which was in its full vigor at the time of the restoration of
Messênê.</p>

<p>The second Messenian war was thus terminated by the complete
subjugation of the Messenians. Such of them as remained in the
country were reduced to a servitude probably not less hard than that
which Tyrtæus described them as having endured between the first
war and the second. In aftertimes, the whole<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_438">[p. 438]</span> territory which figures on the map
as Messenia,—south of the river Nedon, and westward of the summit
of Taygetus,—appears as subject to Sparta, and as forming the
western portion of Laconia; distributed, in what proportion we know
not, between Periœkic towns and Helot villages. By what steps, or
after what degree of farther resistance, the Spartans conquered
this country, we have no information; but we are told that they
made over Asinê to the expelled Dryopes from the Argolic peninsula
and Mothônê to the fugitives from Nauplia.<a id="FNanchor_756"
href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> Nor do we hear of
any serious revolt from Sparta in this territory until one hundred
and fifty years afterwards,<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757"
class="fnanchor">[757]</a> subsequent to the Persian invasion,—a
revolt which Sparta, after serious efforts, succeeded in crushing.
So that the territory remained in her power until her defeat at
Leuktra, which led to the foundation of Messênê by Epameinondas.
The fertility of the plains,—especially of the central portion near
the river Pamisus, so much extolled by observers, modern as well as
ancient,—rendered it an acquisition highly valuable. At some time or
other, it must of course have been formally partitioned among the
Spartans, but it is probable that different and successive allotments
were made, according as the various portions of territory, both to
the east and to the west of Taygetus, were conquered. Of all this
we have no information.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758"
class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>Imperfectly as these two Messenian wars are known to us, we may
see enough to warrant us in making two remarks. Both were tedious,
protracted, and painful, showing how slowly the results of war were
then gathered, and adding one additional illustration to prove how
much the rapid and instantaneous conquest of Laconia and Messenia by
the Dorians, which the Herakleid legend sets forth, is contradicted
by historical analogy. Both were characterized by a similar defensive
proceeding on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[p. 439]</span>
the part of the Messenians,—the occupation of a mountain difficult
of access, and the fortification of it for the special purpose and
resistance,—Ithômê (which is said to have had already a small town
upon it) in the first war, Eira in the second. It is reasonable to
infer from hence, that neither their principal town Stenyklêrus,
nor any other town in their country, was strongly fortified, so as
to be calculated to stand a siege; that there were no walled towns
among them analogous to Mykenæ and Tiryns on the eastern portion of
Peloponnesus; and that, perhaps, what were called towns were, like
Sparta itself, clusters of unfortified villages. The subsequent state
of Helotism into which they were reduced is in consistency with this
dispersed village residence during their period of freedom.</p>

<p>The relations of Pisa and Elis form a suitable counterpart
and sequel to those of Messenia and Sparta. Unwilling subjects
themselves, the Pisatans had lent their aid to the Messenians,—and
their king, Pantaleôn, one of the leaders of this combined force, had
gained so great a temporary success, as to dispossess the Eleians
of the agonothesia or administration of the games for one Olympic
ceremony, in the 34th Olympiad. Though again reduced to their
condition of subjects, they manifested dispositions to renew their
revolt at the 48th Olympiad, under Damophôn, the son of Pantaleôn,
and the Eleians marched into their country to put them down, but
were persuaded to retire by protestations of submission. At length,
shortly afterwards, under Pyrrhus, the brother of Damophôn, a serious
revolt broke out. The inhabitants of Dyspentium, and the other
villages in the Pisatid, assisted by those of Makistus, Skillus,
and the other towns in Triphylia, took up arms to throw off the
yoke of Elis; but their strength was inadequate to the undertaking.
They were completely conquered; Dyspontium was dismantled, and the
inhabitants of it obliged to flee the country, from whence most of
them emigrated to the colonies of Epidamnus and Apollonia, in Epirus.
The inhabitants of Makistus and Skillus were also chased from their
abodes, while the territory became more thoroughly subject to Elis
than it had been before. These incidents seem to have occurred about
the 50th Olympiad, or <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 580; and the dominion
of Elis over her Periœkic territory was thus as well assured as
that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">[p. 440]</span> of Sparta.<a
id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a>
The separate denominations both of Pisa and Triphylia became more
and more merged in the sovereign name of Elis: the town of Lepreum
alone, in Triphylia, seems to have maintained a separate name and
a sort of half-autonomy down to the time of the Peloponnesian
war, not without perpetual struggles against the Eleians.<a
id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>
But towards the period of the Peloponnesian war, the political
interests of Lacedæmon had become considerably changed, and it was
to her advantage to maintain the independence of the subordinate
states against the superior: accordingly, we find her at that time
upholding the autonomy of Lepreum. From what cause the devastation
of the Triphylian towns by Elis, which Herodotus mentions as having
happened in his time, arose, we do not know; the fact seems to
indicate a continual yearning for their original independence,
which was still commemorated, down to a much later period, by
the ancient Amphiktyony, at Samikum, in Triphylia, in honor of
Poseidôn,—a common religious festival frequented by all the
Triphylian towns and celebrated by the inhabitants of Makistus, who
sent round proclamation of a formal truce for the holy period.<a
id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> The
Lacedæmonians, after the close of the Peloponnesian war, had left
them undisputed heads of Greece, formally upheld the independence
of the Triphylian towns against Elis, and seem to have countenanced
their endeavors to attach themselves to the Arcadian aggregate,
which, however, was never fully accomplished. Their dependence on
Elis became loose and uncertain, but was never wholly shaken off.<a

    CONQUESTS OF SPARTA TOWARDS ARCADIA AND ARGOLIS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">I have</span> described in
the last two chapters, as far as our imperfect evidence permits,
how Sparta came into possession both of the southern portion of
Laconia along the coast of the Eurotas down to its mouth, and of
the Messenian territory westward. Her progress towards Arcadia and
Argolis is now to be sketched, so as to conduct her to that position
which she occupied during the reign of Peisistratus at Athens, or
about 560-540 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—a time when she had reached the
maximum of her territorial possessions, and when she was confessedly
the commanding state in Hellas.</p>

<p>The central region of Peloponnesus, called Arcadia, had
never received any emigrants from without. Its indigenous
inhabitants,—a strong and hardy race of mountaineers, the most
numerous Hellenic tribe in the peninsula, and the constant hive
for mercenary troops,<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763"
class="fnanchor">[763]</a>—were among the rudest and poorest of
Greeks, retaining for the longest period their original subdivision
into a number of petty hill-villages, each independent of the other;
while the union of all who bore the Arcadian name,—though they had
some common sacrifices, such as the festival of the Lykæan Zeus, of
Despoina, daughter of Poseidôn and Dêmêtêr, and of Artemis Hymnia,<a
id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>—was
more loose and ineffective than that of Greeks generally, either
in or out of Peloponnesus. The Arcadian villagers were usually
denominated by the names<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">[p.
442]</span> of regions, coincident with certain ethnical
subdivisions,—the Azānes, the Parrhasii, the Mænalii (adjoining
Mount Mænalus), the Eutrêsii, the Ægytæ, the Skiritæ, etc.<a
id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
Some considerable towns, however, there were,—aggregations of
villages or demes which had been once autonomous. Of these,
the principal were Tegea and Mantineia, bordering on Laconia
and Argolis,—Orchomenus, Pheneus, and Stymphalus, towards the
north-east, bordering on Achaia and Phlius,—Kleitôr and Heræa,
westward, where the country is divided from Elis and Triphylia by
the woody mountains of Pholoê and Erymanthus,—and Phigaleia, on the
south-western border near to Messenia. The most powerful of all
were Tegea and Mantineia,<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766"
class="fnanchor">[766]</a>—conterminous towns, nearly equal in force,
dividing between them the cold and high plain of Tripolitza, and
separated by one of those capricious torrents which only escapes
through katabothra. To regulate the efflux of this water was a
difficult task, requiring friendly coöperation of both the towns:
and when their frequent jealousies brought on a quarrel, the more
aggressive of the two inundated the territory of its neighbor as one
means of annoyance. The power of Tegea, which had grown up out of
nine constituent townships, originally separate,<a id="FNanchor_767"
href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> appears to have
been more ancient than that of its rival; as we may judge from its
splendid heroic pretensions connected with the name of Echemus, and
from the post conceded to its hoplites in joint Peloponnesian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[p. 443]</span> armaments, which
was second in distinction only to that of the Lacedæmonians.<a
id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a>
If it be correct, as Strabo asserts,<a id="FNanchor_769"
href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> that the
incorporation of the town of Mantineia, out of its five separate
demes, was brought about by the Argeians, we may conjecture that the
latter adopted this proceeding as a means of providing some check
upon their powerful neighbors of Tegea. The plain common to Tegea and
Mantineia was bounded to the west by the wintry heights of Mænalus,<a
id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
beyond which, as far as the boundaries of Laconia, Messenia, and
Triphylia, there was nothing in Arcadia but small and unimportant
townships, or villages,—without any considerable town, before the
important step taken by Epameinondas in founding Megalopolis, a short
time after the battle of Leuktra. The mountaineers of these regions,
who joined Epameinondas before the battle of Mantineia, at a time
when Mantineia and most of the towns of Arcadia were opposed to him,
were so inferior to the other Greeks in equipment, that they still
carried as their chief weapon, in place of the spear, nothing better
than the ancient club.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771"
class="fnanchor">[771]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">[p. 444]</span></p>

<p>Both Tegea and Mantineia held several of these smaller Arcadian
townships near them in a sort of dependence, and were anxious to
extend this empire over others: during the Peloponnesian war, we
find the Mantineians establishing and garrisoning a fortress at
Kypsela among the Parrhasii, near the site in which Megalopolis
was afterwards built.<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772"
class="fnanchor">[772]</a> But at this period, Sparta, as the
political chief of Hellas,—having a strong interest in keeping all
the Grecian towns, small and great, as much isolated from each
other as possible, and in checking all schemes for the formation
of local confederacies,—stood forward as the protectress of the
autonomy of these smaller Arcadians, and drove back the Mantineians
within their own limits.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773"
class="fnanchor">[773]</a> At a somewhat later period, during the
acmé of her power, a few years before the battle of Leuktra, she
even proceeded to the extreme length of breaking up the unity of
Mantineia itself, causing the walls to be razed, and the inhabitants
to be again parcelled into their five original demes,—a violent
arrangement, which the turn of political events very soon reversed.<a
id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a>
It was not until after the battle of Leuktra and the depression of
Sparta that any measures were taken for the formation of an Arcadian
political confederacy;<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775"
class="fnanchor">[775]</a> and even then, the jealousies of
the separate cites rendered it incomplete and short-lived. The
great permanent change, the establishment of Megalopolis, was
accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[p. 445]</span>
by the ascendency of Epameinondas. Forty petty Arcadian townships,
among those situated to the west of Mount Mænalus, were aggregated
into the new city: the jealousies of Tegea, Mantineia, and Kleitôr,
were for a while suspended; and œkists came from all of them, as
well as from the districts of the Mænalii and Parrhasii, in order to
impart to the new establishment a genuine Pan-Arcadian character.<a
id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a>
It was thus there arose for the first time a powerful city on the
borders of Laconia and Messenia, rescuing the Arcadian townships from
their dependence on Sparta, and imparting to them political interests
of their own, which rendered them, both a check upon their former
chief and a support to the reëstablished Messenians.</p>

<p>It has been necessary thus to bring the attention of the reader
for one moment to events long posterior in the order of time
(Megalopolis was founded in 370 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), in order
that he may understand, by contrast, the general course of those
incidents of the earlier time, where direct accounts are wanting.
The northern boundary of the Spartan territory was formed by some
of the many small Arcadian townships or districts, several of which
were successively conquered by the Spartans and incorporated with
their dominion, though at what precise time we are unable to say. We
are told that Charilaus, the reputed nephew and ward of Lykurgus,
took Ægys, and that he also invaded the territory of Tegea, but with
singular ill-success, for he was defeated and taken prisoner:<a
id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a>
we also hear that the Spartans took Phigaleia by surprise in
the 30th Olympiad, but were driven out again by the neighboring
Arcadian Oresthasians.<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778"
class="fnanchor">[778]</a> During the second Messenian war, the
Arcadians are represented as cordially seconding the Messenians: and
it may seem perhaps singular that, while neither Mantineia nor Tegea
are mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[p. 446]</span>
in this war, the more distant town of Orchomenus, with its king
Aristokratês, takes the lead. But the facts of the contest come
before us with so poetical a coloring, that we cannot venture to draw
any positive inference as to the times to which they are referred.</p>

<p>Œnus<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779"
class="fnanchor">[779]</a> and Karystus seem to have belonged to
the Spartans in the days of Alkman: moreover, the district called
Skirītis bordering on the territory of Tegea,—as well as Belemina
and Maleatis to the westward, and Karyæ to the eastward and
south-eastward, of Skirītis,—forming altogether the entire northern
frontier of Sparta, and all occupied by Arcadian inhabitants,—had
been conquered and made part of the Spartan territory<a
id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
before 600 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> And Herodotus tells us, that at
this period the Spartan kings Leon and Hegesiklês contemplated
nothing less than the conquest of entire Arcadia, and sent to
ask from the Delphian oracle a blessing on their enterprise.<a
id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a>
The priestess dismissed their wishes as extravagant, in reference
to the whole of Arcadia, but encouraged them, though with the
usual equivocations of language, to try their fortune against
Tegea. Flushed with their course of previous success, not less
than by the favorable construction which they put upon the words
of the oracle, the Lacedæmonians marched against Tegea with such
entire confidence of success, as to carry with them chains for the
purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[p. 447]</span> of
binding their expected prisoners. But the result was disappointment
and defeat. They were repulsed with loss, and the prisoners whom
they left behind, bound in the very chains which their own army
had brought, were constrained to servile labor on the plain of
Tegea,—the words of the oracle being thus literally fulfilled,
though in a sense different from that in which the Lacedæmonians
had first understood them.<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782"
class="fnanchor">[782]</a></p>

<p>For one whole generation, we are told, they were constantly
unsuccessful in their campaigns against the Tegeans, and this
strenuous resistance probably prevented them from extending their
conquests farther among the petty states of Arcadia.</p>

<p>At length, in the reign of Anaxandridês and Aristô, the successors
of Leon and Hegesiklês (about 560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), the Delphian
oracle, in reply to a question from the Spartans,—which of the gods
they ought to propitiate in order to become victorious,—enjoined them
to find and carry to Sparta the bones of Orestês, son of Agamemnôn.
After a vain search, since they did not know where the body of
Orestês was to be found, they applied to the oracle for more specific
directions, and were told that the son of Agamemnôn was buried
at Tegea itself, in a place “where two blasts were blowing under
powerful constraint,—where there was stroke and counter-stroke, and
destruction upon destruction.” These mysterious words were elucidated
by a lucky accident. During a truce with Tegea, Lichas, one of the
chiefs of the three hundred Spartan chosen youth, who acted as the
movable police of the country under the ephors, visited the place,
and entered the forge of a blacksmith,—who mentioned to him, in the
course of conversation, that, in sinking a well in his outer court,
he had recently discovered a coffin containing a body seven cubits
long; astounded at the sight, he had left it there undisturbed. It
struck Lichas that the gigantic relic of aforetime could be nothing
else but the corpse of Orestês, and he felt assured of this, when
he reflected how accurately the indications of the oracle were
verified; for there were the “two blasts blowing by constraint,”
in the two bellows of the blacksmith: there<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_448">[p. 448]</span> was the “stroke and counter-stroke,” in
his hammer and anvil, as well as the “destruction upon destruction,”
in the murderous weapons which he was forging. Lichas said nothing,
but returned to Sparta with his discovery, which he communicated
to the authorities, who, by a concerted scheme, banished him under
a pretended criminal accusation. He then returned again to Tegea,
under the guise of an exile, prevailed upon the blacksmith to let
to him the premises, and when he found himself in possession, dug
up and carried off to Sparta the bones of the venerated hero.<a
id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<p>From and after this fortunate acquisition, the character of
the contest was changed; the Spartans found themselves constantly
victorious over the Tegeans. But it does not seem that these
victories led to any positive result, though they might perhaps
serve to enforce the practical conviction of Spartan superiority;
for the territory of Tegea remained unimpaired, and its autonomy
noway restrained. During the Persian invasion, Tegea appears as
the willing ally of Lacedæmon, and as the second military power
in the Peloponnesus;<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784"
class="fnanchor">[784]</a> and we may fairly presume that it was
chiefly the strenuous resistance of the Tegeans which prevented the
Lacedæmonians from extending their empire over the larger portion
of the Arcadian communities. These latter always maintained their
independence, though acknowledging Sparta as the presiding power in
Peloponnesus, and obeying her orders implicitly as to the disposal of
their military force. And the influence which Sparta thus possessed
over all Arcadia was one main item in her power, never seriously
shaken until the battle of Leuktra; which took away her previous
means of insuring success and plunder to her minor followers.<a
id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<p>Having thus related the extension of the power of Sparta on
her northern or Arcadian frontier, it remains to mention her
acquisitions on the eastern and north-eastern side, towards Argos.
Originally, as has been before stated, not merely the province of
Kynuria and the Thyreātis but also the whole coast down to the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[p. 449]</span> promontory of Malea,
had either been part of the territory of Argos or belonged to the
Argeian confederacy. We learn from Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_786"
href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> that before the time
when the embassy from Crœsus, king of Lydia, came to solicit aid in
Greece (about 547 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), the whole of this territory
had fallen into the power of Sparta; but how long before, or at what
precise epoch, we have no information. A considerable victory is
said to have been gained by the Argeians over the Spartans in the
27th Olympiad or 669 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, at Hysiæ, on the road
between Argos and Tegea.<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787"
class="fnanchor">[787]</a> At that time it does not seem probable
that Kynuria could have been in the possession of the Spartans,—so
that we must refer the acquisition to some period in the following
century; though Pausanias places it much earlier, during the
reign of Theopompus,<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788"
class="fnanchor">[788]</a>—and Eusebius connects it with the first
establishment of the festival called Gymnopædia at Sparta, in 678
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

<p>About the year 547 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the Argeians made an
effort to reconquer Thyrea from Sparta, which led to a combat long
memorable in the annals of Grecian heroism. It was agreed between
the two powers that the possession of this territory should be
determined by a combat of three hundred select champions on each
side; the armies of both retiring, in order to leave the field
clear. So undaunted and so equal was the valor of these two chosen
companies, that the battle terminated by leaving only three of them
alive,—Alkênôr and Chromius among the Argeians, Othryadês among the
Spartans. The two Argeian warriors hastened home to report their
victory, but Othryadês remained on the field, carried off the arms
of the enemy’s dead into the Spartan camp, and kept his position
until he was joined by his countrymen the next morning. Both Argos
and Sparta claimed the victory for their respective champions, and
the dispute after all was decided by a general conflict, in which
the Spartans were the conquerors, though not without much slaughter
on both sides. The brave Othryadês, ashamed to return home as the
single survivor of the three hundred, fell upon his own sword on
the field of battle.<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789"
class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>This defeat decided the possession of Thyrea, which did not<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[p. 450]</span> again pass, until
a very late period of Grecian history, under the power of Argos.
The preliminary duel of three hundred, with its uncertain issue,
though well established as to the general fact, was represented
by the Argeians in a manner totally different from the above
story, which seems to have been current among the Lacedæmonians.<a
id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a>
But the most remarkable circumstance is, that more than a century
afterwards,—when the two powers were negotiating for a renewal of
the then expiring truce, the Argeians, still hankering after this
their ancient territory, desired the Lacedæmonians to submit the
question to arbitration; which being refused, they next stipulated
for the privilege of trying the point in dispute by a duel similar
to the former, at any time except during the prevalence of war or
of epidemic disease. The historian tells us that the Lacedæmonians
acquiesced in this proposition, though they thought it absurd,<a
id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a>
in consequence of their anxiety to keep their relations with Argos
at that time smooth and pacific. But there is no reason to imagine
that the real duel, in which Othryadês contended, was considered as
absurd at the time when it took place, or during the age immediately
succeeding. It fell in with a sort of chival<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_451">[p. 451]</span>rous pugnacity which is noticed
among the attributes of the early Greeks,<a id="FNanchor_792"
href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> and also with various
legendary exploits, such as the single combat of Echemus and Hyllus,
of Melanthus and Xanthus, of Menelaus and Paris, etc. Moreover,
the heroism of Othryadês and his countrymen was a popular theme
for poets, not only at the Spartan gymnopædia,<a id="FNanchor_793"
href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> but also elsewhere,
and appears to have been frequently celebrated. The absurdity
attached to this proposition, then, during the Peloponnesian war,—in
the minds even of the Spartans, the most old-fashioned and unchanging
people in Greece,—is to be ascribed to a change in the Grecian
political mind, at and after the Persian war. The habit of political
calculation had made such decided progress among them, that the
leading states especially had become familiarized with something
like a statesmanlike view of their resources, their dangers, and
their obligations. How lamentably deficient this sort of sagacity was
during the Persian invasion, will appear when we come to describe
that imminent crisis of Grecian independence: but the events of
those days were well calculated to sharpen it for the future, and
the Greeks of the Peloponnesian war had become far more refined
political schemers than their forefathers. And thus it happened
that the proposition to settle a territorial dispute by a duel of
chosen champions, admissible and even becoming a century before, came
afterwards to be derided as childish.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Kynuria are stated by Herodotus to have been
Ionians, but completely Dorized through their long subjection to
Argos, by whom they were governed as Periœki. Pausanias gives a
different account of their race, which he traces to the eponymous
hero Kynūrus, son of Perseus: but he does not connect them with the
Kynurians whom he mentions in another place as a portion of the
inhabitants of Arcadia.<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794"
class="fnanchor">[794]</a> It is evident that, even in the time
of Herodotus, the traces of their primitive descent were nearly
effaced. He says they were “Orneates and Periœki” to Argos; and
it appears that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[p.
452]</span> inhabitants of Orneæ also, whom Argos had reduced
to the same dependent condition, traced their eponymous hero to
an Ionic stock,—Orneus was the son of the Attic Erechtheus.<a
id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>
Strabo seems to have conceived the Kynurians as occupying originally,
not only the frontier district of Argolis and Laconia, wherein Thyrea
is situated, but also the north-western portion of Argolis, under the
ridge called Lyrkeium, which separates the latter from the Arcadian
territory of Stimphalus.<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796"
class="fnanchor">[796]</a> This ridge was near the town of Orneæ,
which lay on the border of Argolis near the confines of Phlius; so
that Strabo thus helps to confirm the statement of Herodotus, that
the Orneates were a portion of Kynurians, held by Argos along with
the other Kynurians in the condition of dependent allies and Periœki,
and very probably also of Ionian origin.</p>

<p>The conquest of Thyrea (a district valuable to the Lacedæmonians,
as we may presume from the large booty which the Argeians got
from it during the Peloponnesian war)<a id="FNanchor_797"
href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> was the last
territorial acquisition made by Sparta. She was now possessed of
a continuous dominion, comprising the whole southern portion of
the Peloponnesus, from the southern bank of the river Nedon on the
western coast, to the northern boundary of Thyreatis on the eastern
coast. The area of her territory, including as it did both Laconia
and Messenia, was equal to two-fifths of the entire peninsula, all
governed from the single city, and for the exclusive purpose and
benefit of the citizens of Sparta. Within all this wide area there
was not a single community pretending to independent agency. The
townships of the Periœki, and the villages of the Helots, were each
individually unimportant; nor do we hear of any one of them presuming
to treat with a foreign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[p.
453]</span> state: both consider themselves as nothing else but
subjects of the Spartan ephors and their subordinate officers. They
are indeed discontented subjects, hating as well as fearing their
masters, and not to be trusted if a favorable opportunity for secure
revolt presents itself. But no individual township or district is
strong enough to stand up for itself, while combinations among
them are prevented by the habitual watchfulness and unscrupulous
precautions of the ephors, especially by that jealous secret police
called the Krypteia, to which allusion has already been made.</p>

<p>Not only, therefore, was the Spartan territory larger and its
population more numerous than that of any other state in Hellas, but
its government was also more completely centralized and more strictly
obeyed. Its source of weakness was the discontent of its Periœki
and Helots, the latter of whom were not—like the slaves of other
states—imported barbarians from different countries, and speaking
a broken Greek, but genuine Hellens,—of one dialect and lineage,
sympathizing with each other, and as much entitled to the protection
of Zeus Hellanius as their masters,—from whom, indeed, they stood
distinguished by no other line except the perfect training,
individual and collective, which was peculiar to the Spartans. During
the period on which we are at present dwelling, it does not seem that
this discontent comes sensibly into operation; but we shall observe
its manifestations very unequivocally after the Persian and during
the Peloponnesian war.</p>

<p>To such auxiliary causes of Spartan predominance we must
add another,—the excellent military position of Sparta, and
the unassailable character of Laconia generally. On three
sides that territory is washed by the sea,<a id="FNanchor_798"
href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> with a coast
remarkably dangerous and destitute of harbors; hence Sparta had
nothing to apprehend from this quarter until the Persian invasion
and its consequences,—one of the most remarkable of which was, the
astonishing development of the Athenian naval force. The city of
Sparta, far removed from the sea, was admirably defended by an almost
impassable northern frontier, composed of those districts which we
have observed above to have been conquered from<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_454">[p. 454]</span> Arcadia,—Karyātis, Skirītis, Maleātis,
and Beleminātis. The difficulty as well as danger of marching
into Laconia by these mountain passes, noticed by Euripides, was
keenly felt by every enemy of the Lacedæmonians, and has been
powerfully stated by a first-rate modern observer, Colonel Leake.<a
id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> No
site could be better chosen for holding the key of all the penetrable
passes than that of Sparta. This well-protected frontier was a
substitute more than sufficient for fortifications to Sparta itself,
which always maintained, down to the times of the despot Nabis,
its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">[p. 455]</span> primitive
aspect of a group of adjacent hill-villages rather than a regular
city.</p>

<p>When, along with such territorial advantages, we contemplate
the personal training peculiar to the Spartan citizens, as yet
undiminished in their numbers,—combined with the effect of that
training upon Grecian sentiment, in inspiring awe and admiration,—we
shall not be surprised to find that, during the half-century which
elapsed between the year 600 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> and the final
conquest of Thyreātis from Argos, Sparta had acquired and begun
to exercise a recognized ascendency over all the Grecian states.
Her military force was at that time superior to that of any of
the rest, in a degree much greater than it afterwards came to be;
for other states had not yet attained their maximum, and Athens
in particular was far short of the height which she afterwards
reached. In respect to discipline as well as number, the Spartan
military force had even at this early period reached a point which
it did not subsequently surpass; while in Athens, Thebes, Argos,
Arcadia, and even Elis (as will be hereafter shown), the military
training in later days received greater attention, and improved
considerably. The Spartans (observes Aristotle)<a id="FNanchor_800"
href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> brought to perfection
their gymnastic training and their military discipline, at a time
when other Greeks neglected both the one and the other: their
early superiority was that of the trained men over the untrained,
and ceased in after-days, when other states came to subject their
citizens to systematic exercises of analogous character or tendency.
This fact,—the early period at which Sparta attained her maximum
of discipline, power, and territory,—is important to bear in mind,
when we are explaining the general acquiescence which her ascendency
met with in Greece, and which her subsequent acts would certainly
not have enabled her to earn. That acquiescence first began, and
became a habit of the Grecian mind, at a time when Sparta had no
rival to come near her,—when she had complete<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_456">[p. 456]</span>ly shot ahead of Argos,—and when the
vigor of the Lykurgean discipline had been manifested in a long
series of conquests, made during the stationary period of other
states, and ending only, to use the somewhat exaggerated phrase of
Herodotus, when she had subdued the greater part of Peloponnesus.<a
id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p>Our accounts of the memorable military organization of Sparta
are scanty, and insufficient to place the details of it clearly
before us. The arms of the Spartans, as to all material points,
were not different from those of other Greek hoplites. But one
grand peculiarity is observable from the beginning, as an item in
the Lykurgean institutions. That lawgiver established military
divisions quite distinct from the civil divisions, whereas in the
other states of Greece, until a period much later than that which
we have now reached, the two were confounded,—the hoplites or
horsemen of the same tribe or ward being marshalled together on the
field of battle. Every Lacedæmonian was bound to military service
from the age of twenty to sixty, and the ephors, when they sent
forth an expedition, called to arms all the men within some given
limit of age. Herodotus tells us that Lykurgus established both
the syssitia, or public mess, and the enômoties and triākads, or
the military subdivisions peculiar to Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_802"
href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> The triākads are
not mentioned elsewhere, nor can we distinctly make out what they
were; but the enômoty was the special characteristic of the system,
and the pivot upon which all its arrangements turned. It was a
small company of men, the number of whom was variable, being given
differently at twenty-five, thirty-two, or thirty-six men,—drilled
and practised together in military evolutions, and bound to each
other by a common oath.<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803"
class="fnanchor">[803]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">[p.
457]</span> Each enômoty had a separate captain, or enomotarch, the
strongest and ablest soldier of the company, who always occupied
the front rank, and led the enômoty when it marched in single
file, giving the order of march, as well as setting the example.
If the enômoty was drawn up in three, or four, or six files, the
enomotarch usually occupied the front post on the left, and care was
taken that both the front-rank men and the rear-rank men, of each
file, should be soldiers of particular merit.<a id="FNanchor_804"
href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<p>It was upon these small companies that the constant and severe
Lacedæmonian drilling was brought to act. They were taught to march
in concert, to change rapidly from line to file, to wheel right or
left in such manner as that the enomotarch and the other protostates,
or front-rank men, should always be the persons immediately
opposed to the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805"
class="fnanchor">[805]</a> Their step was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_458">[p. 458]</span> regulated by the fife, which played
in martial measures peculiar to Sparta, and was employed in actual
battle as well as in military practice; and so perfectly were
they habituated to the movements of the enômoty, that, if their
order was deranged by any adverse accident, scattered soldiers
could spontaneously form themselves into the same order, each man
knowing perfectly the duties belonging to the place into which
chance had thrown him.<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806"
class="fnanchor">[806]</a> Above the enômoty were several
larger divisions,—the pentekostys, the lochus, and the mora,<a
id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> of
which latter there seem to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[p.
459]</span> have been <i>six</i> in all. Respecting the number of each
division, and the proportion of the larger to the smaller, we
find statements altogether different, yet each resting upon good
authority,—so that we are driven to suppose that there was no
peremptory standard, and that the enômoty comprised twenty-five,
thirty-two, or thirty-six men; the pentekostys, two or four
enômoties; the lochus, two or four pentekosties, and the mora,
four hundred, five hundred, six hundred, or nine hundred men,—at
different times, or according to the limits of age which the ephors
might prescribe for the men whom they called into the field.<a
id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a></p>

<p>What remains fixed in the system is, first, the small number,
though varying within certain limits, of the elementary company
called enômoty, trained to act together, and composed of men
nearly of the same age,<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809"
class="fnanchor">[809]</a> in which every man knew his place;
secondly, the scale of divisions and the hierarchy of officers, each
rising above the other,—the enômotarch, the pentekontêr, the lochage,
and the polemarch, or commander of the mora,—each having the charge
of their respective divisions. Orders were<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_460">[p. 460]</span> transmitted from the king, as
commander-in-chief, through the polemarchs to the lochages,—from
the lochages to the pentekonters, and then from the latter to the
enômotarchs, each of whom caused them to be executed by his enômoty.
As all these men had been previously trained to the duties of their
respective stations, the Spartan infantry possessed the arrangements
and aptitudes of a standing army. Originally, they seem to have
had no cavalry at all,<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810"
class="fnanchor">[810]</a> and when cavalry was at length introduced
into their system, it was of a very inferior character, no provision
having been made for it in the Lykurgean training. But the military
force of the other cities of Greece, even down to the close of the
Peloponnesian war, enjoyed little or no special training, having
neither any small company like the enômoty, consisting of particular
men drilled to act together,—no fixed and disciplined officers,—nor
triple scale of subordination and subdivision. Gymnastics, and
the use of arms, made a part of education everywhere, and it is
to be presumed that no Grecian hoplite was entirely without some
practice of marching in line and military evolutions, inasmuch as
the obligation to serve was universal and often enforced. But such
practice was casual and unequal, nor had any individual of Argos
or Athens a fixed military place and duty. The citizen took arms
among his tribe, under a taxiarch, chosen from it for the occasion,
and was placed in a rank or line wherein neither his place nor
his immediate neighbors were predetermined. The tribe appears to
have been the only military classification known to Athens,<a
id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> and
the taxi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">[p. 461]</span>arch the
only tribe officer for infantry, as the phylarch was for cavalry,
under the general-in-chief. Moreover, orders from the general were
proclaimed to the line collectively by a herald of loud voice, not
communicated to the taxiarch so as to make him responsible for
the proper execution of them by his division. With an arrangement
thus perfunctory and unsystematized, we shall be surprised to
find how well the military duties were often performed: but every
Greek who contrasted it with the symmetrical structure of the
Lacedæmonian armed force, and with the laborious preparation of every
Spartan for his appropriate duty, felt an internal sentiment of
inferiority, which made him willingly accept the headship of “these
professional artists in the business of war,”<a id="FNanchor_812"
href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> as they are often
denominated.</p>

<p>It was through the concurrence of these various circumstances
that the willing acknowledgment of Sparta as the leading state
of Hellas became a part of Grecian habitual sentiment, during
the interval between about 600 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> and 547
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> During this period too, chiefly, Greece
and her colonies were ripening into a sort of recognized and active
partnership. The common religious assemblies, which bound the parts
together, not only acquired greater formality and more extended
development, but also became more numerous and frequent,—while the
Pythian, Isthmian, and Nemean games were exalted into a national
importance, approaching to that of the Olympic. The recognized
superiority of Sparta thus formed part and parcel of the first
historical aggregation of the Grecian states. It was about the year
547 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, that Crœsus of Lydia, when pressed by Cyrus
and the Persians, solicited aid from Greece, addressing himself<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[p. 462]</span> to the Spartans as
confessed presidents of the whole Hellenic body.<a id="FNanchor_813"
href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> And the tendencies
then at work, towards a certain degree of increased intercourse and
coöperation among the dispersed members of the Hellenic name, were
doubtless assisted by the existence of a state recognized by all as
the first,—a state whose superiority was the more readily acquiesced
in, because it was earned by a painful and laborious discipline,
which all admired, but none chose to copy.<a id="FNanchor_814"
href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<p>Whether it be true, as O. Müller and other learned men conceive,
that the Homeric mode of fighting was the general practice in
Peloponnesus and the rest of Greece anterior to the invasion of
the Dorians, and that the latter first introduced the habit of
fighting with close ranks and protended spears, is a point which
cannot be determined. Throughout all our historical knowledge of
Greece, a close rank among the hoplites, charging with spears always
in hand, is the prevailing practice; though there are cases of
exception, in which the spear is hurled, when troops seem afraid of
coming to close quarters.<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815"
class="fnanchor">[815]</a> Nor is it by any means certain,
that the Homeric manner of fighting ever really prevailed in
Peloponnesus, which is a country eminently inconvenient for the use
of war-chariots. The descriptions of the bard may perhaps have been
founded chiefly upon what he and his auditors witnessed on the coast
of Asia Minor, where chariots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[p.
463]</span> were more employed, and where the country was much
more favorable to them.<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816"
class="fnanchor">[816]</a> We have no historical knowledge of any
military practice in Peloponnesus anterior to the hoplites with close
ranks and protended spears.</p>

<p>One Peloponnesian state there was, and one alone, which
disdained to acknowledge the superiority or headship of Lacedæmon.
Argos never forgot that she had once been the chief power in the
peninsula, and her feeling towards Sparta was that of a jealous,
but impotent, competitor. By what steps the decline of her power
had taken place, we are unable to make out, nor can we trace the
succession of her kings subsequent to Pheidôn. It has been already
stated that, about 669 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the Argeians gained a
victory over the Spartans at Hysiæ, and that they expelled from the
port of Nauplia its preëxisting inhabitants, who found shelter, by
favor of the Lacedæmonians, at the port of Mothônê, in Messenia:<a
id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a>
Damokratidas was then king of Argos. Pausanias tells us that Meltas,
the son of Lakidês, was the last descendant of Temenus who succeeded
to this dignity; he being condemned and deposed by the people.
Plutarch, however, states that the family of the Herakleids died
out, and that another king, named Ægôn, was chosen by the people
at the indication of the Delphian oracle.<a id="FNanchor_818"
href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> Of this story,
Pausanias appears to have known nothing. His language implies that
the kingly dignity ceased with Meltas,—wherein he is undoubtedly
mistaken, since the title existed, though probably with very
limited functions, at the time of the Persian war. Moreover, there
is some ground for presuming that the king of Argos was even at
that time a Herakleid,—since the Spartans offered to him a third
part of the command of the Hellenic force, conjointly with<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[p. 464]</span> their own two kings.<a
id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a>
The conquest of Thyreātis by the Spartans deprived the Argeians of
a valuable portion of their Periœkis, or dependent territory; but
Orneæ, and the remaining portion of Kynuria,<a id="FNanchor_820"
href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> still continued to
belong to them; the plain round their city was very productive; and
except Sparta, there was no other power in Peloponnesus superior
to them. Mykenæ and Tiryns, nevertheless, seem both to have been
independent states at the time of the Persian war, since both
sent contingents to the battle of Platæa, at a time when Argos
held aloof and rather favored the Persians. At what time Kleônæ
became the ally, or dependent, of Argos, we cannot distinctly
make out. During the Peloponnesian war, it is numbered in that
character along with Orneæ;<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821"
class="fnanchor">[821]</a> but it seems not to have lost its
autonomy about the year 470 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, at which period
Pindar represents the Kleonæans as presiding and distributing prizes
at the Nemean games.<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822"
class="fnanchor">[822]</a> The grove of Nemea was less than two
miles from their town, and they were the original presidents of this
great festival,—a function of which they were subsequently robbed by
the Argeians, in the same manner as the Pisatans had been treated
by the Eleians with reference to the Olympic Agôn. The extinction
of the autonomy of Kleônæ and the acquisition of the presidency of
the Nemean festival by Argos, were doubtless simultaneous, but we
are unable to mark the exact time; for the statement of Eusebius,
that the Argeians celebrated the Nemean festival as early as the 53d
Olympiad, or 568 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, is contradicted by the more
valuable evidence of Pindar.<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823"
class="fnanchor">[823]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[p. 465]</span>Of Corinth
and Sikyôn it will be more convenient to speak when we survey what
is called the Age of the Tyrants, or Despots; and of the inhabitants
of Achaia (who occupied the southern coast of the Corinthian gulf,
westward of Sikyôn, as far as Cape Araxus, the north-western point
of Peloponnesus), a few words exhaust our whole knowledge, down
to the time at which we are arrived. These Achæans are given to
us as representing the ante-Dorian inhabitants of Laconia, whom
the legend affirms to have retired under Tisamenus to the northern
parts of Peloponnesus, from whence they expelled the preëxisting
Ionians and occupied the country. The race of their kings is said
to have lasted from Tisamenus down to Ogygus,<a id="FNanchor_824"
href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>—how long, we do not
know. After the death of the latter, the Achæan towns formed each
a separate republic, but with periodical festivals and sacrifice
at the temple of Zeus Homarius, affording opportunity of settling
differences and arranging their common concerns. Of these towns,
twelve are known from Herodotus and Strabo,—Pellênê, Ægira, Ægæ,
Bura, Helikê, Ægium, Rhypes, Patræ, Pharæ, Olenus, Dymê, Tritæa.<a
id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>
But there must originally have been some other autonomous towns
besides these twelve; for in the 23d Olympiad, Ikarus of Hyperêsia
was proclaimed as victor, and there seems good reason to believe that
Hyperêsia, an old town of the Homeric Catalogue, was in Achaia.<a
id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a>
It is affirmed that, before the Achæan occupation of the country,
the Ionians had dwelt in independent villages, several of which
were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[p. 466]</span> subsequently
aggregated into towns: thus Patræ was formed by a coalescence of
seven villages, Dymê from eight (one of which was named Teuthea),
and Ægium also from seven or eight. But all these towns were
small, and some of them underwent a farther junction one with the
other; thus Ægæ was joined with Ægeira, and Olenus with Dymê.<a
id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> All
the authors seem disposed to recognize twelve cities, and no more,
in Achaia; for Polybius, still adhering to that number, substitutes
Leontium and Keryneia in place of Ægæ and Rhypes; Pausanias gives
Keryneia in place of Patræ.<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828"
class="fnanchor">[828]</a> We hear of no facts respecting these
Achæan towns until a short time before the Peloponnesian war, and
even then their part was inconsiderable.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the territory comprised under the name
of Achaia was mountain, forming the northern descent of those
high ranges, passable only through very difficult gorges, which
separate the country from Arcadia to the south, and which throw
out various spurs approaching closely to the gulf of Corinth. A
strip of flat land, with white clayey soil, often very fertile,
between these mountains and the sea, formed <i>the plain</i> of each
of the Achæan towns, which were situated for the most part upon
steep outlying eminences overhanging it. From the mountains between
Achaia and Arcadia, numerous streams flow into the Corinthian gulf,
but few of them are perennial, and the whole length of coast is
represented as harborless.<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829"

<p>The Doric institutions are called by Pindar τεθμοὶ Αἰγιμίου
Δωρικοί (Pyth. i. 124).</p>

<p>There existed an ancient epic poem, now lost, but cited on some
few occasions by authors still preserved, under the title Αἰγίμιος;
the authorship being sometimes ascribed to Hesiod, sometimes to
Kerkops (Athenæ. xi. p. 503). The few fragments which remain do not
enable us to make out the scheme of it, inasmuch as they embrace
different mythical incidents lying very wide of each other,—Iô, the
Argonauts, Pêleus, and Thetis, etc. But the name which it bears seems
to imply that the war of Ægimius against the Lapithæ, and the aid
given to him by Hêraklês, was one of its chief topics. Both O. Müller
(History of the Dorians, vol. i. b. 1, c. 8) and Welcker (Der Epische
Kyklus, p. 263) appear to me to go beyond the very scanty evidence
which we possess, in their determination of this last poem; compare

Œnomaus ap. Eusebium, Præparat. Evangel. v. p. 211. According
to that statement, both Kleodæus (here called <i>Aridæus</i>) son of
Hyllus, and Aristomachus son of Kleodæus, had made separate and
successive attempts at the head of the Herakleids to penetrate into
Peloponnêsus through the Isthmus: both had failed and perished,
having misunderstood the admonition of the Delphian oracle. Œnomaus
could have known nothing of the pledge given by Hyllus, as the
condition of the single combat between Hyllus and Echemus (according
to Herodotus), that the Herakleids should make no fresh trial for
one hundred years; if it had been understood that they had given and
then violated such a pledge, such violation would probably have been
adduced to account for their failure.</p>

l’institution des Olympiades. La perte des ouvrages d’Ephore et de

point conservées dans les écrits des contemporains, au moins le

<p>C. Müller thinks (in his Annotatio ad Marmor Parium, appended to
the Fragmenta Historicorum Græcorum, ed. Didot, pp. 556, 568, 572;
compare his Prefatory notice of the Fragments of Hellanikus, p.
xxviii. of the same volume) that the ancient chronologists, in their
arrangement of the mythical events as antecedent and consequent, were
guided by certain numerical attachments, especially by a reverence
for the cycle of 63 years, product of the sacred numbers 7 × 9 = 63.
I cannot think that he makes out his hypothesis satisfactorily, as to
the particular cycle followed, though it is not improbable that some
preconceived numerical theories <i>did</i> guide these early calculators.
He calls attention to the fact that the Alexandrine computation of
dates was only one among a number of others discrepant, and that
modern inquirers are too apt to treat it as if it stood alone, or
carried some superior authority, (pp. 568-572; compare Clemen. Alex.
Stromat. i. p. 145, Sylb.) For example, O. Müller observes, (Appendix
to Hist. of Dorians, p. 442,) that “Larcher’s criticism and rejection
of the Alexandrine chronologists may perhaps be found as groundless
as they are presumptuous,”—an observation, which, to say the least
of it, ascribes to Eratosthenês a far higher authority than he is
entitled to.</p>

<p id="Footnote_74"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_74">[74]</a></span> The distinction which Mr. Clinton
draws between an upward and a downward chronology is one that I
am unable to comprehend. His doctrine is, that upward chronology
is trustworthy and practicable up to the first recorded Olympiad;
downward chronology is trustworthy and practicable from Phorôneus
down to the Ionic migration: what is uncertain is, the length of
the intermediate line which joins the Ionic migration to the first
recorded Olympiad,—the downward and the upward terminus. (See Fasti
Hellenici, vol. i. Introduct. p. ix. second edit. and p. 123, ch.
vi.)</p>

<p>All chronology must begin by reckoning upwards: when by this
process we have arrived at a certain determined era in earlier time,
we may from that date reckon downwards, if we please. We must be
able to reckon upwards from the present time to the Christian era,
before we can employ that event as a fixed point for chronological
determinations generally. But if Eratosthenês could perform correctly
the upward reckoning from his own time to the fall of Troy, so he
could also perform the upward reckoning up to the nearer point of
the Ionic migration. It is true that Eratosthenês gives all his
statements of time from an older point to a newer (so far at least
as we can judge from Clemens Alex. Strom. 1, p. 336); he says
“From the capture of Troy to the return of the Herakleids is 80
years; from thence to the Ionic migration, 60 years; then, farther
on, to the guardianship of Lykurgus, 159 years; then to the first
year of the first Olympiad, 108 years; from which Olympiad to the
invasion of Xerxês, 297 years; from whence to the beginning of
the Peloponnesian war, 48 years,” etc. But here is no difference
between upward reckoning as high as the first Olympiad, and then
downward reckoning for the intervals of time above it. Eratosthenês
first found or made some upward reckoning to the Trojan capture,
either from his own time or from some time at a known distance from
his own: he then assumes the capture of Troy as an era, and gives
statements of intervals going downwards to the Peloponnesian war:
amongst other statements, he assigns clearly that interval which
Mr. Clinton pronounces to be undiscoverable, viz. the space of time
between the Ionic emigration and the first Olympiad, interposing one
epoch between them. I reject the computation of Eratosthenês, or any
other computation, to determine the supposed date of the Trojan war;
but, if I admitted it, I could have no hesitation in admitting also
the space which he defines between the Ionic migration and the first
Olympiad. Eusebius (Præp. Ev. x. 9, p. 485) reckons upwards from the
birth of Christ, making various halts, but never breaking off, to the
initial phenomena of Grecian antiquity,—the deluge of Deukalion and
the conflagration of Phaëtôn.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_75"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_75">[75]</a></span> See the string of fabulous names
placed at the head of the Halikarnassian Inscription, professing
to enumerate the series of priests of Poseidôn from the foundation
of the city (Inscript. No. 2655, Boeckh), with the commentary of
the learned editor: compare, also, what he pronounces to be an
inscription of a genealogy partially fabulous at Hierapytna in Krête
(No. 2563).</p>

<p>The memorable Parian marble is itself an inscription, in which
legend and history—gods, heroes, and men—are blended together in the
various successive epochs without any consciousness of transition in
the mind of the inscriber.</p>

<p>That the Catalogue of Priestesses of Hêrê at Argos went back to
the extreme of fabulous times, we may discern by the Fragments of
Hellanikus (Frag. 45-53). So also did the registers at Sikyôn: they
professed to record Amphion, son of Zeus and Antiopê, as the inventor
of harp-music (Plutarch, De Musicâ, c. 3, p. 1132).</p>

<p>I remarked in the preceding page, that Mr. Clinton erroneously
cites K. O. Müller as a believer in the chronological <i>authenticity</i>
of the lists of the early Spartan kings: he says (vol. iii. App.
vi. p. 330), “Mr. Müller is of opinion that an <i>authentic</i> account
of the years of each Lacedæmonian reign from the return of the
Heraclidæ to the Olympiad of Korœbus had been preserved to the
time of Eratosthenês and Apollodôrus.” But this is a mistake; for
Müller expressly disavows any belief in the <i>authenticity</i> of the
lists (Dorians, i. p. 146): he says: “I do not contend that the
chronological accounts in the Spartan lists form <i>an authentic
document</i>, more than those in the catalogue of the priestesses of
Hêrê and in the list of Halikarnassian priests. The chronological
statements in the Spartan lists may have been formed from imperfect
memorials: but the Alexandrine chronologists must have found such
tables in existence,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>The discrepancies noticed in Herodotus (vi. 52) are alone
sufficient to prove that continuous registers of the names of the
Lacedæmonian kings did not begin to be kept until very long after the
date here assigned by Mr. Clinton.</p>

<p>Xenophôn (Agesilaus, viii. 7) agrees with what Herodotus mentions
to have been the native Lacedæmonian story,—that Aristodêmus (and not
his sons) was the king who conducted the Dorian invaders to Sparta.
What is farther remarkable is, that Xenophôn calls him—Ἀριστόδημος ὁ
Ἡρακλέους. The reasonable inference here is, that Xenophôn believed
Aristodêmus to be the <i>son</i> of Hêraklês, and that this was one of the
various genealogical stories current. But here the critics interpose;
“ὁ Ἡρακλἑους (observes Schneider,) non παῖς, sed ἀπόγονος, ut ex
Herodoto, viii. 131, admonuit Weiske.” Surely, if Xenophôn had meant
this, he would have said ὁ ἀφ᾽ Ἡρακλέους.</p>

<p>Perhaps particular exceptional cases might be quoted, wherein the
very common phrase of ὁ, followed by a genitive, means <i>descendant</i>,
and not <i>son</i>. But if any doubt be allowed upon this point,
chronological computations, founded on genealogies, will be exposed
to a serious additional suspicion. Why are we to assume that Xenophôn
<i>must</i> give the same story as Herodotus, unless his words naturally
tell us so?</p>

<p class="mt1">Democritus estimated a space of seven hundred and
thirty years between his composition of the Μικρὸς Διάκοσμος and
the capture of Troy (Diogen. Laërt. ix. 41). Isokratês believed the
Lacedæmonians to have been established in Peloponnêsus seven hundred
years, and he repeats this in three different passages (Archidam. p.
118; Panathen. p. 275; De Pace, p. 178). The dates of these three
orations themselves differ by twenty-four years, the Archidamus
being older than the Panathenaïc by that interval; yet he employs
the same number of years for each in calculating backwards to the
Trojan war, (see Clinton, vol. i. Introd. p. v.) In round numbers,
his calculation coincides pretty nearly with the eight hundred years
given by Herodotus in the preceding century.</p>

<p>The remarks of Boeckh on the Parian marble generally, in his
Corpus Inscriptionum Græc. t. ii. pp. 322-336, are extremely
valuable, but especially his criticism on the epoch of the Trojan
war, which stands the twenty-fourth in the Marble. The ancient
chronologists, from Damastês and Hellanikus downwards, professed to
fix not only the exact year, but the exact month, day, and hour in
which this celebrated capture took place. [Mr. Clinton pretends to
no more than the possibility of determining the event within fifty
years, Introduct. p. vi.] Boeckh illustrates the manner of their
argumentation.</p>

<p>O. Müller observes (History of the Dorians, t. ii. p. 442, Eng.
Tr.), “In reckoning from the migration of the Heraklidæ downward, we
follow the Alexandrine chronology, of which it should be observed,
that our materials only enable us to restore it to its original
state, <i>not to examine its correctness</i>.”</p>

<p>But I do not see upon what evidence even so much as this can be
done. Mr. Clinton, admitting that Eratosthenês fixed his date by
conjecture, supposes him to have chosen “a middle point between the
longer and shorter computations of his predecessors.” Boeckh thinks
this explanation unsatisfactory (<i>l. c.</i> p. 328).</p>

et arbusta et pascui læti atque uberes” (Cicero, De Republ. v. 2):
the German kings received presents: “Mos est civitatibus (observes
Tacitus, respecting the Germans whom he describes, M. G. 15) ultro
ac viritim conferre principibus, vel armentorum vel frugum, quod pro
honore acceptum etiam necessitatibus subvenit.”</p>

<p>The revenue of the Persian kings before Darius consisted only of
what were called δῶρα, or presents (Herod. iii. 89): Darius first
introduced both the name of tribute and the determinate assessment.
King Polydektês, in Seriphos, invites his friends to a festival, the
condition of which is that each guest shall contribute to an ἔρανος
for his benefit (Pherekydês, Fragm. 26, ed. Didot); a case to which
the Thracian banquet prepared by Seuthês affords an exact parallel
(Xenophôn, Anab. vii. 3, 16-32: compare Thucyd. ii. 97, and Welcker,
Æschyl. Trilogie, p. 381). Such Aids, or Benevolences, even if
originally voluntary, became in the end compulsory. In the European
monarchies of the Middle Ages, what were called free gifts were more
ancient than public taxes: “The feudal Aids (observes Mr. Hallam) are
the beginning of taxation, of which they for a long time answered the
purpose.” (Middle Ages, ch. ii. part i. p. 189.) So about the Aides
in the old French Monarchy, “La Cour des Aides avoit été instituée,
et sa jurisdiction s’étoit formée, lorsque le domaine des Rois
suffisoit à toutes les dépenses de l’Etat, les droits d’Aides étoient
alors des supplémens peu considérables et toujours temporaires.
Depuis, le domaine des Rois avoit été anéanti: les Aides, au
contraire, étoient devenues permanentes et formoient presque la
totalité des ressources du trésor.” (Histoire de la Fronde, par M. de
St. Aulaire, ch. iii. p. 124.)</p>

<p>The language of Aristotle (Polit. iii. 10, 1) is much the same:
Ἡ βασιλεία—ἡ περὶ τοὺς ἡρωικοὺς χρόνους—αὐτὴ δ᾽ ἦν ἑκόντων μὲν, ἐπί

<p>It can hardly be said correctly, however, that the king’s
authority was <i>defined</i>: nothing can well be more indefinite.</p>

<p>Agamemnôn enjoyed or assumed the power of putting to death a
disobedient soldier (Aristot. Polit. iii. 9, 2). The words which
Aristotle read in the speech of Agamemnôn in the Iliad—Πὰρ γὰρ ἐμοὶ
θάνατος—are not in our present copies: the Alexandrine critics
effaced many traces of the old manners.</p>

words ἀγαθὸς, ἐσθλὸς, κακὸς, etc. copiously illustrated in Welcker’s
excellent Prolegomena to Theognis, sect. 9-16. Camerarius, in his
notes on that poet (v. 19,), had already conceived clearly the sense
in which these words are used. Iliad, xv. 323. Οἶα τε τοῖς ἀγαθοῖσι
παραδρώωσι χέρηες. Compare Hesiod, Opp. Di. 216, and the line in
Athenæus, v. p. 178, Αὐτόματοι δ᾽ ἀγαθοὶ δειλῶν ἐπὶ δαῖτας ἴασιν.</p>

<p>“<i>Moralis</i> illarum vocum vis, et <i>civilis</i>—quarum hæc a
lexicographis et commentatoribus plurimis fere neglecta est—probe
discernendæ erunt. Quod quo facilius fieret, nescio an ubi posterior
intellectus valet, majusculâ scribendum fuisset Ἀγαθοὶ et Κακοὶ.”</p>

<p>If this advice of Welcker could have been followed, much
misconception would have been obviated. The reference of these words
to power and not to worth, is their primitive import in the Greek
language, descending from the Iliad downward, and determining the
habitual designation of parties during the period of active political
dispute. The ethical meaning of the word hardly appears until the
discussions raised by Socrates, and prosecuted by his disciples;
but the primitive import still continued to maintain concurrent
footing.</p>

<p>I shall have occasion to touch more largely on this subject,
when I come to expound the Grecian political parties. At present,
it is enough to remark that the epithets of <i>good men</i>, <i>best men</i>,
habitually applied afterwards to the aristocratical parties, descend
from the rudest period of Grecian society.</p>

<p>Dionysius of Halikarnassus (ii. 12) pays rather too high a
compliment to the moderation of the Grecian heroic kings.</p>

<p>The kings at Rome, like the Grecian heroic kings, began with
an ἀρχὴ ἀνυπεύθυνος: the words of Pomponius (De Origine Juris, i.
2,) would be perhaps more exactly applicable to the latter than
to the former: “Initio civitatis nostræ Populus sine certâ lege,
sine jure certo, primum agere instituit: omniaque manu a Regibus
gubernabantur.” Tacitus says (Ann. iii. 26), “Nobis Romulus, ut
libitum, imperitaverat: dein Numa religionibus et divino jure populum
devinxit, repertaque quædam a Tullo et Anco: sed præcipuus Servius
Tullius sanctor legum fuit, quis etiam Reges obtemperarent.” The
appointment of a Dictator under the Republic was a reproduction,
for a short and definite interval, of this old unbounded authority
(Cicero, De Repub. ii. 32; Zonaras, Ann. vii. 13; Dionys. Hal. v.
75).</p>

maintained in the Dorian states, and obliterated only in the Ionian
and democratical. In this point, he has been followed by various
other authors (see Helbig, Die Sittlich. Zustände des Heldenalters,
p. 73), but his position appears to me substantially incorrect, even
as regards Sparta; and strikingly incorrect, in regard to the other
Dorian states.</p>

Xenophôn (vii. 2, 33), describes how, when an orphan youth, he
formerly supplicated Mêdokos, the Thracian king, to grant him a troop
of followers, in order that he might recover his lost dominions,
ἐκαθεζόμην ἐνδίφριος αὐτῷ ἱκέτης δοῦναί μοι ἄνδρας.</p>

<p>Thucydidês gives an interesting description of the arrival of the
exile Themistoklês, then warmly pursued by the Greeks on suspicion of
treason, at the house of Admêtus, king of the Epirotic Molossians.
The wife of Admêtus herself instructed the fugitive how to supplicate
her husband in form: the child of Admêtus was placed in his arms, and
he was directed to sit down in this guise close by the consecrated
hearth, which was of the nature of an altar. While so seated, he
addressed his urgent entreaties to Admêtus for protection: the latter
raised him up from the ground and promised what was asked. “That
(says the historian) was the most powerful form of supplication.”
Admêtus,—ἀκούσας ἀνίστησί τε αὐτὸν μετὰ τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ υἱέος, ὥσπερ καὶ
ἔχων αὐτὸν ἐκαθέζετο, καὶ <em class="gesperrt">μέγιστον ἱκέτευμα</em>
ἦν τοῦτο (Thuc. i. 136). So Têlephus, in the lost drama of Æschylus
called Μυσοὶ, takes up the child Orestês. See Bothe’s Fragm. 44;
Schol. Aristoph. Ach. 305.</p>

<p>In the Odyssey, both Nausikaa and the goddess Athênê instruct
Odysseus in the proper form of supplicating Alkinous: he first throws
himself down at the feet of queen Arêtê, embracing her knees and
addressing to her his prayer, and then, without waiting for a reply,
sits down among the ashes on the hearth,—ὣς εἰπὼν, κατ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἕζετ᾽
ἐπ᾽ ἐσχάρῃ ἐν κονίῃσι,—Alkinous is dining with a large company:
for some time both he and the guests are silent: at length the
ancient Echenêus remonstrates with him on his tardiness in raising
the stranger up from the ashes. At his exhortation, the Phæakian
king takes Odysseus by the hand, and, raising him up, places him on
a chair beside him: he then directs the heralds to mix a bowl of
wine, and to serve it to every one round, in order that all may make
libations to Zeus Hiketêsios. This ceremony clothes the stranger with
the full rights and character of a suppliant (Odyss. vi. 310; vii.
75, 141, 166): κατὰ νόμους ἀφικτόρων, Æschyl. Supplic. 242.</p>

<p>That the form counted for a great deal, we see evidently marked:
but of course supplication is often addressed, and successfully
addressed, in circumstances where this form cannot be gone
through.</p>

<p>It is difficult to accept the doctrine of Eustathius (ad Odyss.
xvi. 424), that ἱκέτης is a <i>vox media</i> (like ξεῖνος), applied as
well to the ἱκετάδοχος as to the ἱκέτης, properly so called: but the
word ἀλλήλοισιν, in the passage just cited, does seem to justify his
observation: yet there is no direct authority for such use of the
word in Homer.</p>

<p>The address of Theoclymenos, on first preferring his supplication
to Telemachus, is characteristic of the practice (Odyss. xv. 260);
compare also Iliad, xvi. 574, and Hesiod. Scut. Hercul. 12-85.</p>

<p>The idea of the ξεῖνος and the ἱκέτης run very much together. I
can hardly persuade myself that the reading ἱκέτευσε (Odyss. xi.
520) is truly Homeric: implying as it does the idea of a pitiable
sufferer, it is altogether out of place when predicated of the proud
and impetuous Neoptolemus: we should rather have expected ἐκέλευσε.
(See Odyss. x. 15.)</p>

<p>The constraining efficacy of special formalities of supplication,
among the Scythians, is powerfully set forth in the Toxaris of
Lucian: the suppliant sits upon an ox-hide, with his hands confined
behind him (Lucian, Toxaris c. 48, vol. iii. p. 69, Tauchn.)—the
μεγίστη ἱκετηρία among that people.</p>

Homeric word; νόμος, <i>law</i>, in the singular, occurs twice in the
Hesiodic Works and Days (276, 388).</p>

<p>The employment of the words δίκη, δίκαι, θέμις, θέμιστες, in
Homer, is curious as illustrating the early moral associations,
but would require far more space than can be given to it in a
note; we see that the sense of each of these words was essentially
fluctuating. <i>Themis</i>, in Homer, is sometimes decidedly a <i>person</i>,
who exercises the important function of opening and closing the
agora, both of gods and men (Iliad, xx. 4: Odyss. ii. 68), and
who, besides that, acts and speaks (Iliad, xiv. 87-93): always the
associate and companion of Zeus, the highest god. In Hesiod, (Theog.
901,) she is the wife of Zeus: in Æschylus, (Prometh. 209,) she is
the same as Γαῖα: even in Plato, (Legg. xi. p. 936,) witnesses swear
(to want of knowledge of matters under inquest) by Zeus, Apollo,
and Themis. Themis <i>as a person</i> is probably the oldest sense of
the word: then we have the plural θέμιστες (connected with the verb
τίθεμι, like θεσμὸς and τεθμὸς), which are (not persons, but) special
appurtenances or emanations of the supreme god, or of a king acting
under him, analogous to and joined with the sceptre. The sceptre, and
the θέμιστες or the δίκαι constantly go together (Iliad, ii. 209; ix.
99): Zeus or the king is a judge, not a lawmaker; he issues decrees
or special orders to settle particular disputes, or to restrain
particular men; and, agreeable to the concrete forms of ancient
language, the decrees are treated as if they were a collection of
ready-made substantive things, actually in his possession, like
the sceptre, and prepared for being delivered out when the proper
occasion arose: δικασπόλοι, οἵτε θέμιστας Πρὸς Διὸς εἰρύαται (Il.
i. 238), compared with the two passages last cited: Ἄφρονα τοῦτον
ἀνέντας, ὃς οὔτινα οἶδε θέμιστα (Il. v. 761), Ἄγριον, οὔτε δίκας εὖ
εἰδότα οὔτε θέμιστας (Odyss. ix. 215). The plural number δίκαι is
more commonly used in Homer than the singular: δίκη is rarely used
to denote Justice, an an abstract conception; it more often denotes
a special claim of right on the part of some given man (Il. xviii.
508). It sometimes also denotes, simply, established custom, or the
known lot,—δμώων δίκη, γερόντων, θείων βασιλήων, θεῶν (see Damm’s
Lexicon, <i>ad voc.</i>) θέμις is used in the same manner.</p>

The ἔδνα, or present given by the suitor to the father, as an
inducement to grant his daughter in marriage, are spoken of as very
valuable,—ἀπερείσια ἔδνα (Il. xi. 244; xvi. 178; xxii. 472): to
grant a daughter without ἔδνα was a high compliment to the intended
son-in-law (Il. ix. 141: compare xiii. 366). Among the ancient
Germans of Tacitus, the husband gave presents, not to his wife’s
father, but to herself (Tacit. Germ. c. 18): the customs of the early
Jews were in this respect completely Homeric; see the case of Shechem
and Dinah (Genesis, xxxiv. 12) and others, etc.; also Mr. Catlin’s
Letters on the North American Indians, vol. i. Lett. 26, p. 213.</p>

<p>The Greek ἔδνα correspond exactly to the <i>mundium</i> of the Lombard
and Alemannic laws, which is thus explained by Mr. Price (Notes on
the Laws of King Ethelbert, in the Ancient Laws and Institutes of
England, translated and published by Mr. Thorpe, vol. i. p. 20): “The
Longobardic law is the most copious of all the barbaric codes in its
provisions respecting marriage, and particularly so on the subject
of the Mund. From that law it appears that the Mundium was a sum
paid over to the family of the bride, for transferring the tutelage
which they possessed over her to the family of the husband: ‘Si quis
pro muliere liberâ aut puellâ mundium dederit et ei tradita fuerit
ad uxorem,’ etc. (ed. Rotharis, c. 183.) In the same sense in which
the term occurs in these dooms, it is also to be met with in the
Alemannic law: it was also common in Denmark and in Sweden, where the
bride was called a mund-bought or a mund-given woman.”</p>

<p>According to the 77th Law of King Ethelbert (p. 23), this
<i>mund</i> was often paid in cattle: the Saxon daughters were πάρθενοι
ἀλφεσίβοιαι (Iliad, xviii. 593).</p>

<p>Pomponius Mela describes the ancient Germans in language not
inapplicable to the Homeric Greeks: “Jus in viribus habent, adeo
ut ne latrocinii quidem pudeat: <i>tantum</i> hospitibus boni, mitesque
supplicibus.” (iii. 3.)</p>

<p>“The hospitality of the Indians is well known. It extends even to
strangers who take refuge among them. They count it a most sacred
duty, from which no one is exempted. Whoever refuses relief to any
one, commits a grievous offence, and not only makes himself detested
and abhorred by all, but liable to revenge from the offended person.
In their conduct towards their enemies they are cruel and inexorable,
and, when enraged, bent upon nothing but murder and bloodshed. They
are, however, remarkable for concealing their passions, and waiting
for a convenient opportunity of gratifying them. But then their fury
knows no bounds. If they cannot satisfy their resentment, they will
even call upon their friends and posterity to do it. The longest
space of time cannot cool their wrath, nor the most distant place
of refuge afford security to their enemy.” (Loskiel, History of the
Mission of the United Brethren among the North American Indians, Part
I. ch. 2, p. 15.)</p>

<p>“Charlevoix observes, (says Dr. Ferguson, Essay on Civil Society,
Part II. § 2, p. 145,) that the nations among whom he travelled in
North America never mentioned acts of generosity or kindness under
the notion of duty. They acted from affection, as they acted from
appetite, without regard to its consequences. When they had done a
kindness, they had gratified a desire: the business was finished,
and it passed from the memory. The spirit with which they give or
receive presents is the same as that which Tacitus remarks among
the ancient Germans: ‘Gaudent muneribus, sed nec data imputant, nec
acceptis obligantur.’ Such gifts are of little consequence, except
when employed as the seal of a bargain or a treaty.”</p>

<p>Respecting the Morlacchi (Illyrian Sclavonians), the Abbé Fortis
says (Travels in Dalmatia, pp. 55-58):—</p>

<p>“The hospitality of the Morlachs is equally conspicuous among
the poor as among the opulent. The rich prepares a roasted lamb
or sheep, and the poor, with equal cordiality, gives his turkey,
milk, honey,—whatever he has. Nor is their generosity confined
to strangers, but generally extends to all who are in want....
Friendship is lasting among the Morlacchi. They have even made it
a kind of religious point, and tie the sacred bond at the foot of
the altar. The Sclavonian ritual contains a particular benediction,
for the solemn union of two male or two female friends, in presence
of the whole congregation. The male friends thus united are called
Pobratimi, and the females Posestreme, which means half-brothers and
half-sisters. The duties of the Pobratimi are, to assist each other
in every case of need and danger, to revenge mutual wrongs, etc.:
their enthusiasm is often carried so far as to risk, and even lose
their life.... But as the friendships of the Morlacchi are strong and
sacred, so their quarrels are commonly unextinguishable. They pass
from father to son, and the mothers fail not to put their children
in mind of their duty to revenge their father, if he has had the
misfortune to be killed, and to show them often the bloody shirt of
the deceased.... A Morlach is implacable, if injured or insulted.
With him, revenge and justice have exactly the same meaning, and
truly it is the primitive idea, and I have been told that in Albania
the effects of revenge are still more atrocious and more lasting.
There, a man of the mildest character is capable of the most
barbarous revenge, believing it to be his positive duty.... A Morlach
who has killed another of a powerful family is commonly obliged to
save himself by flight, and keep out of the way for several years. If
during that time he has been fortunate enough to escape the search
of his pursuers, and has got a small sum of money, he endeavors to
obtain pardon and peace.... It is the custom in some places for the
offended party to threaten the criminal, holding all sorts of arms to
his throat, and at last to consent to accept his ransom.”</p>

<p>Concerning the influence of these two distinct tendencies—devoted
personal friendship and implacable animosities—among the
Illyrico-Sclavonian population, see Cyprien Robert, Les Slaves de
la Turquie, ch. vii. pp. 42-46, and Dr. Joseph Müller, Albanien,
Rumelien, und die Œsterreichisch-Montenegrenische Gränze, Prag. 1844,
pp. 24-25.</p>

<p>“It is for the virtue of hospitality (observes Goguet, Origin of
Laws, etc. vol. i. book vi. ch. iv.), that the primitive times are
chiefly famed. But, in my opinion, hospitality was then exercised,
not so much from generosity and greatness of soul, as from necessity.
Common interest probably gave rise to that custom. In remote
antiquity, there were few or no public inns: they entertained
strangers, in order that they might render them the same service,
if they happened to travel into their country. Hospitality was
reciprocal. When they received strangers into their houses, they
acquired a right of being received into theirs again. This right
was regarded by the ancients as sacred and inviolable, and extended
not only to those who had acquired it, but to their children and
posterity. Besides, hospitality in these times could not be attended
with much expense: men travelled but little. In a word, the modern
Arabians prove that hospitality may consist with the greatest vices,
and that this species of generosity is no decisive evidence of
goodness of heart, or rectitude of manners.”</p>

<p>The book of Genesis, amidst many other features of resemblance to
the Homeric manners, presents that of ready and exuberant hospitality
to the stranger.</p>

Thucydidês, undistinguishing plunder at sea, committed by Greek ships
against ships not Greek, seems not to have been held discreditable.
The Phokæan Dionysius, after the ill-success of the Ionic revolt,
goes with his three ships of war to Sicily, and from thence plunders
Tyrrhenians and Carthaginians (Herod. vi. 17).—ληϊστὴς κατεστήκεε,
Ἑλλήνων μὲν οὐδενὸς, Καρχηδονίων δὲ καὶ Τυρσηνῶν. Compare the conduct
of the Phokæan settlers at Alalia in Corsica, after the conquest of
Ionia by Harpagus (Herodot. i. 166).</p>

<p>In the treaty between the Romans and Carthaginians, made at some
period subsequent to 509 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, it is stipulated,—Τοῦ
Καλοῦ Ἀκρωτηρίου, Μαστίας, Ταρσηΐου, μὴ ληΐζεσθαι ἐπέκεινα Ῥωμαίους
μηδ᾽ ἐμπορεύεσθαι, μηδὲ πόλιν κτίζειν (Polyb. iii. 24, 4). Plunder,
commerce, and colonization, are here assumed as the three objects
which the Roman ships would pursue, unless they were under special
obligation to abstain, in reference to foreigners. This morality
approaches nearer to that of the Homeric age, than to the state of
sentiment which Thucydides indicates as current in his day among the
Greeks.</p>

<p>“An Indian feast (says Loskiel, Mission of the United Brethren in
North America,) is seldom concluded without bloodshed. For the murder
of a man one hundred yards of wampum, and for that of a woman two
hundred yards, must be paid by the murderer. If he is too poor, which
is commonly the case, and his friends cannot or will not assist him,
he must fly from the resentment of the relations.”</p>

<p>Rogge (Gerichtswesen der Germanen, capp. 1, 2, 3), Grimm
(Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer, book v. cap. 1-2), and Eichhorn
(Deutsches Privat-Recht. sect. 48) have expounded this idea, and the
consequences deduced from it among the ancient Germans.</p>

<p>Aristotle alludes, as an illustration of the extreme silliness of
ancient Greek practices (εὐήθη πάμπαν), to a custom which he states
to have still continued at the Æolic Kymê, in cases of murder. If
the accuser produced in support of his charge a certain number of
witnesses from his own kindred, the person was held peremptorily
guilty,—οἷον ἐν Κύμῃ περὶ τὰ φονικὰ νόμος ἔστιν, ἂν πλῆθός τι
παράσχηται μαρτύρων ὁ διώκων τὸν φόνον τῶν αὑτοῦ συγγενῶν, ἔνοχον
εἶναι τῷ φόνῳ τὸν φεύγοντα (Polit. ii. 5, 12). This presents a
curious parallel with the old German institution of the Eideshelfern,
or conjurators, who, though most frequently required and produced
in support of the party accused, were yet also brought by the party
accusing. See Rogge, sect. 36, p. 186; Grimm, p. 862.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_158"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_158">[158]</a></span> The word ποινὴ indicates this
<i>satisfaction by valuable payment</i> for wrong done, especially for
homicide: that the Latin word <i>pœna</i> originally meant the same thing,
may be inferred from the old phrases <i>dare pœnas, pendere pœnas</i>. The
most illustrative passage in the Iliad is that in which Ajax, in the
embassy undertaken to conciliate Achilles, censures by comparison the
inexorable obstinacy of the latter in setting at naught the proffered
presents of Agamemnôn (Il. ix. 627):—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Νηλής· καὶ μὲν τίς τε κασιγνήτοιο φόνοι</p>
<p class="i0">Ποινὴν, ἢ οὗ παιδὸς ἐδέξατο τεθνειῶτος·</p>
<p class="i0">Καί ῥ᾽ ὁ μὲν ἐν δήμῳ μένει αὐτοῦ, πολλ᾽ ἀποτίσας·</p>
<p class="i0">Τοῦ δέ τ᾽ ἐρητύεται κραδίη καὶ θύμος ἀγήνωρ,</p>
<p class="i0">Ποινὴν δεξαμένου....</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">The ποινὴ is, in its primitive sense, a genuine
payment in valuable commodities serving as compensation (Iliad,
iii. 290; v. 266; xiii. 659): but it comes by a natural metaphor to
signify the death of one or more Trojans, as a satisfaction for that
of a Greek warrior who had just fallen (or <i>vice versâ</i>, Iliad, xiv.
483; xvi. 398); sometimes even the notion of compensation generally
(xvii. 207). In the representation on the shield of Achilles, the
genuine proceeding about ποινὴ clearly appears: the question there
tried is, whether the payment stipulated as satisfaction for a person
slain, has really been made or not,—δύο δ᾽ ἄνδρες ἐνείκεον εἵνεκα
ποινῆς Ἀνδρὸς ἀποφθιμένου, etc. (xviii. 498.)</p>

<p>The danger of an act of homicide is proportioned to the number
and power of the surviving relatives of the slain; but even a small
number is sufficient to necessitate flight (Odyss. xxiii. 120): on
the other hand, a large body of relatives was the grand source of
encouragement to an insolent criminal (Odyss. xviii. 141).</p>

<p>An old law of Tralles in Lydia, enjoining a nominal ποινὴ of a
medimnus of beans to the relatives of a murdered person belonging
to a contemptible class of citizens, is noticed by Plutarch, Quæst.
Græc. c. 46, p. 302. Even in the century preceding Herodotus, too,
the Delphians gave a ποινὴ as satisfaction for the murder of the
fabulist Æsop; which ποινὴ was claimed and received by the grandson
of Æsop’s master (Herodot. ii. 134. Plutarch. Ser. Num. Vind. p.
556).</p>

<p>Plato (De Legg. ix. pp. 871-874), in his copious penal suggestions
to deal with homicide, both intentional and accidental, concurs in
general with the old Attic law (see Matthiæ, Miscellanea Philologica,
vol. i. p. 151): and as he states with sufficient distinctness the
grounds of his propositions, we see how completely the idea of a
right to private or family revenge is absent from his mind. In one
particular case, he confers upon kinsmen the privilege of avenging
their murdered relative (p. 871); but generally, he rather seeks
to enforce upon them strictly the duty of bringing the suspected
murderer to trial before the court. By the Attic law, it was only
the kinsmen of the deceased who had the right of prosecuting for
murder,—or the master, if the deceased was an οἰκέτης (Demosthen.
cont. Euerg. et Mnesibul. c. 18); they might by forgiveness shorten
the term of banishment for the unintentional murderer (Demosth.
cont. Makart. p. 1069). They seem to have been regarded, generally
speaking, as religiously obliged, but not legally compellable, to
undertake this duty; compare Plato, Euthyphro, capp. 4 and 5.</p>

revenue, etc.; the curnum, who keeps the accounts of cultivation,
etc.; the tallier; the boundary-man; the superintendent of tanks and
water-courses; the Brahman, who performs the village worship; the
schoolmaster; the calendar Brahman, or astrologer, who proclaims the
lucky or unpropitious periods for sowing or thrashing; the smith and
carpenter; the potter; the washerman; the barber; the cowkeeper; the
doctor; the dancing-girl, who attends at rejoicings; the musician,
and the poet.”</p>

<p>Each of these officers and servants (δημιοεργοί) is remunerated by

(<i>ad loc.</i>), Nitzsch (ad Odyss. iv. 643), and Lehrs (Quæst. Epic.

advising that the houseless Thête should be at that moment <i>taken
on</i>, just at the time when the summer’s work was finished. Lehrs
(and seemingly Göttling also), sensible that this can never have
been the real meaning of the poet, would throw out the two lines as
spurious. I may remark farther that the translation of θὴς given

<p class="mt1">The interesting narrative given by Eumæus, of the
manner in which he fell into slavery, is a vivid picture of Phœnician
dealing (compare Herodot. i. 2-4. Iliad, vi. 290; xxiii. 743). Paris
is reported to have visited Sidon, and brought from thence women
eminent for skill at the loom. The Cyprian Verses (see the Argument.
ap. Düntzer, p. 17) affirmed that Paris had landed at Sidon, and
attacked and captured the city. Taphian corsairs kidnapped slaves at
Sidon (Odyss. xv. 424).</p>

<p>The ornaments or trinkets (ἀθύρματα) which the Phœnician merchant
carries with him, seem to be the same as the δαίδαλα πολλὰ, Πόρπας τε
γναμπτάς θ᾽ ἕλικας, etc. which Hêphæstus was employed in fabricating
(Iliad, xviii. 400) under the protection of Thetis.</p>

<p id="Footnote_185"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_185">[185]</a></span> Ivory is frequently mentioned
in Homer, who uses the word ἐλέφας exclusively to mean that
substance, not to signify the animal.</p>

<p>The art of dyeing, especially with the various shades of purple,
was in after-ages one of the special excellences of the Phœnicians:
yet Homer, where he alludes in a simile to dyeing or staining,
introduces a Mæonian or Karian woman as the performer of the process,
not a Phœnician (Iliad, iv. 141).</p>

<p>What the <i>electrum</i> named in the Homeric poems really is cannot
be positively determined. The word in antiquity meant two different
things: 1, amber; 2, an impure gold, containing as much as one-fifth
or more of silver (Pliny, H. N. xxxiii. 4). The passages in which
we read the word in the Odyssey do not positively exclude either
of these meanings; but they present to us electrum so much in
juxtaposition with gold and silver each separately, that perhaps the
second meaning is more probable than the first. Herodotus understands
it to mean <i>amber</i> (iii. 115): Sophoklês, on the contrary, employs it
to designate a metal akin to gold (Antigone, 1033).</p>

<p>See the dissertation of Buttmann, appended to his collection of
essays called <i>Mythologus</i>, vol. ii. p. 337; also, Beckmann, History
of Inventions, vol. iv. p. 12, Engl. Transl. “The ancients (observes
the latter) used as a peculiar metal a mixture of gold and silver,
because they were not acquainted with the art of separating them,
and gave it the name of <i>electrum</i>.” Dr. Thirlwall (Hist. of Greece,
vol. i. p. 241) thinks that the Homeric <i>electrum</i> is amber; on the
contrary, Hüllmann thinks that it was a metallic substance (Handels,
Geschichte der Griechen, pp. 63-81).</p>

<p>Beckmann doubts whether the oldest κασσίτερος of the Greeks was
really <i>tin</i>: he rather thinks that it was “the <i>stannum</i> of the
Romans, the <i>werk</i> of our smelting-houses,—that is, a mixture of
lead, silver, and other accidental metals.” (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 20). The
Greeks of Massalia procured tin from Britain, through Gaul, by the
Seine, the Saone, and the Rhone (Diodôr. v. 22).</p>

The examination of the various matters of antiquity discoverable
throughout the north of Europe, as published by the Antiquarian
Society of Copenhagen, recognizes a distinction of three successive
ages: 1. Implements and arms of stone, bone, wood, etc.: little or no
use of metals at all; clothing made of skins. 2. Implements and arms
of copper and gold, or rather bronze and gold; little or no silver or
iron. Articles of gold and electrum are found belonging to this age,
but none of silver, nor any evidences of writing. 3. The age which
follows this has belonging to it arms of iron, articles of silver,
and some Runic inscriptions: it is the last age of northern paganism,
immediately preceding the introduction of Christianity (Leitfaden zur
Nördischen Alterthumskunde, pp. 31, 57, 63, Copenhagen, 1837).</p>

<p>The Homeric age coincides with the second of these two periods.
Silver is comparatively little mentioned in Homer, while both bronze
and gold are familiar metals. Iron also is rare, and seems employed
only for agricultural purposes—Χρυσόν τε, χαλκόν τε ἅλις, ἐσθῆτα θ᾽
ὑφαντήν (Iliad, vi. 48; Odyss. ii. 338; xiii. 136). The χρυσοχόος and
the χαλκεὺς are both mentioned in Homer, but workers in silver and
iron are not known by any special name (Odyss. iii. 425-436).</p>

<p>“The hatchet, wimble, plane, and level, are the tools mentioned
by Homer, who appears to have been unacquainted with the saw, the
square, and the compass.” (Gillies, Hist. of Greece, chap. ii. p.
61.)</p>

<p>The Gauls, known to Polybius, seemingly the Cisalpine Gauls
only, possessed all their property in cattle and gold,—θρέμματα καὶ
χρυσὸς,—on account of the easy transportability of both (Polyb. ii.
17).</p>

hurling the spear as still prevalent,—δόρυ δ᾽ εὐτόλμως <em

had his mind prepossessed with the Homeric array, or else the close
order and conjunct spears of the hoplites had not yet been introduced
during the second Messenian war.</p>

<p>Thiersch and Schneidewin would substitute πάλλοντες in place of
βάλλοντες. Euripidês (Androm. 695) has a similar expression, yet
it does not apply well to hoplites; for one of the virtues of the
hoplite consisted in carrying his spear steadily: δοράτων κίνησις
betokens a disorderly march, and the want of steady courage and
self-possession. See the remarks of Brasidas upon the ranks of the
Athenians under Kleon at Amphipolis (Thucyd. v. 6).</p>

but the sentiment of the Grecian heroic poetry seems not to go
against it,—it is looked upon as a natural employment of superior
force,—Αὐτόματοι δ᾽ ἀγαθοὶ δειλῶν ἐπὶ δαῖτας ἴασιν (Athenæ. v. p.
178; comp. Pindar, Fragm. 48, ed. Dissen.): the long spear, sword,
and breastplate, of the Kretan Hybreas, constitute his wealth
(Skolion 27, p. 877; Poet. Lyric. ed. Bergk), wherewith he ploughs
and reaps,—while the unwarlike, who dare not or cannot wield these
weapons, fall at his feet, and call him The Great King. The feeling
is different in the later age of Demêtrius Poliorkêtês (about 310
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>): in the Ithyphallic Ode, addressed to him
at his entrance into Athens, robbery is treated as worthy only of
Ætolians:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p class="toright mt1">(Poet. Lyr. xxv. p. 453, ed. Schneid.)</p>

<p class="mt1">The robberies of powerful men, and even highway
robbery generally found considerable approving sentiment in the
Middle Ages. “All Europe (observes Mr. Hallam, Hist. Mid. Ag. ch.
viii. part 3, p. 247) was a scene of intestine anarchy during the
Middle Ages: and though England was far less exposed to the scourge
of private war than most nations on the continent, we should
find, could we recover the local annals of every country, such an
accumulation of petty rapine and tumult, as would almost alienate
us from the liberty which served to engender it.... Highway robbery
was from the earliest times a sort of national crime.... We know how
long the outlaws of Sherwood lived in tradition; men who, like some
of their betters, have been permitted to redeem, by a few acts of
generosity, the just ignominy of extensive crimes. These, indeed,
were the heroes of vulgar applause; but when such a judge as Sir
John Fortescue could exult, that more Englishmen were hanged for
robbery in one year than French in seven,—and that, <i>if an Englishman
be poor, and see another having riches, which may be taken from
him by might, he will not spare to do so</i>,—it may be perceived how
thoroughly these sentiments had pervaded the public mind.”</p>

<p>The robberies habitually committed by the noblesse of France
and Germany during the Middle Ages, so much worse than anything in
England,—and those of the highland chiefs even in later times,—are
too well known to need any references: as to France, an ample
catalogue is set forth in Dulaure’s Histoire de la Noblesse (Paris,
1792). The confederations of the German cities chiefly originated in
the necessity of keeping the roads and rivers open for the transit
of men and goods against the nobles who infested the high roads.
Scaliger might have found a parallel to the λῃσταὶ of the heroic ages
in the noblesse of la Rouergue, as it stood even in the 16th century,
which he thus describes: “In Comitatu Rodez pessimi sunt; nobilitas
ibi latrocinatur: nec possunt reprimi.” (ap. Dulaure, c. 9.)</p>

<p id="Footnote_209"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_209">[209]</a></span> We have very little information
respecting the early Grecian mode of computing time, and we know
that though all the different states computed by lunar periods, yet
most, if not all, of them had different names of months as well
as different days of beginning and ending their months. All their
immediate computations, however, were made by months: the lunar
period was their immediate standard of reference for determining
their festivals, and for other purposes, the solar period being
resorted to only as a corrective, to bring the same months constantly
into the same seasons of the year. Their original month had thirty
days, and was divided into three decades, as it continued to be
during the times of historical Athens (Hesiod. Opp. Di. 766). In
order to bring this lunar period more nearly into harmony with the
sun, they intercalated every year an additional month: so that their
years included alternately twelve months and thirteen months, each
month of thirty days. This period was called a Dieteris,—sometimes
a Trieteris. Solon is said to have first introduced the fashion
of months differing in length, varying alternately from thirty to
twenty-nine days. It appears, however, that Herodotus had present to
his mind the Dieteric cycle, or years alternating between thirteen
months and twelve months (each month of thirty days), and no other
(Herodot. i. 32; compare ii. 104). As astronomical knowledge
improved, longer and more elaborate periods were calculated,
exhibiting a nearer correspondence between an integral number of
lunations and an integral number of solar years. First, we find a
period of four years; next, the Octaëteris, or period of eight years,
or seventy-nine lunar months; lastly, the Metonic period of nineteen
years, or 235 lunar months. How far any of these larger periods
were ever legally authorized, or brought into civil usage, even at
Athens, is matter of much doubt. See Ideler, Uber die Astronomischen
Beobachtungen der Alten, pp. 175-195; Macrobius, Saturnal. i. 13.</p>

superintendent of the Alexandrine library under Ptolemy Philadelphus,

Plautus, published not many years ago by Osann, and since more
fully by Ritschl,—“Cæcius in commento Comœdiarum Aristophanis in

Buttmann’s edition: this was the Odyssey copied or edited along with
the other poems of the cycle.</p>

<p>Our word to <i>edit</i>—or <i>edition</i>—suggests ideas not exactly suited
to the proceedings of the Alexandrine library, in which we cannot
expect to find anything like what is now called <i>publication</i>.
That magnificent establishment, possessing a large collection of
epical manuscripts, and ample means of every kind at command,
would naturally desire to have these compositions put in order and
corrected by skilful hands, and then carefully copied for the use of
the library. Such copy constitutes the cyclic <i>edition</i>: they might
perhaps cause or permit duplicates to be made, but the ἔκδοσις or

<p id="Footnote_225"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_225">[225]</a></span> Our information respecting
the Epic Cycle is derived from Eutychius Proclus, a literary man of
Sicca during the second century of the Christian era, and tutor of
Marcus Antoninus (Jul. Capitolin. Vit. Marc. c. 2),—not from Proclus,
called Diadochus, the new-Platonic philosopher of the fifth century,
as Heyne, Mr. Clinton, and others have imagined. The fragments from
his work called Chrestomathia, give arguments of several of the lost
cyclic poems connected with the Siege of Troy, communicating the
important fact that the Iliad and Odyssey were included in the cycle,
and giving the following description of the principle upon which
it was arranged: Διαλαμβάνει δὲ περὶ τοῦ λεγομένου ἐπικοῦ κύκλου,
ὃς ἄρχεται μὲν ἐκ τῆς Οὐράνου καὶ Γῆς ὁμολογουμένης μίξεως ... καὶ
περατοῦται ὁ ἐπικὸς κύκλος, ἐκ διαφόρων ποιητῶν συμπληρούμενος, μέχρι
τῆς ἀποβάσεως Ὀδυσσέως.... Λέγει δὲ ὡς τοῦ ἐπικοῦ κύκλου τὰ ποιήματα
διασώζεται καὶ σπουδάζεται τοῖς πολλοῖς, οὐχ οὕτω διὰ τὴν ἀρετὴν, ὡς
διὰ τὴν <em class="gesperrt">ἀκολουθίαν τῶν ἐν αὐτῇ πραγμάτων</em>
(ap. Photium, cod. 239).</p>

<p>This much-commented passage, while it clearly marks out the
cardinal principle of the Epic Cycle (ἀκολουθία πραγμάτων), neither
affirms nor denies anything respecting the excellence of the
constituent poems. Proclus speaks of the taste common in his own time
(σπουδάζεται τοῖς πολλοῖς): there was not much relish in his time for
these poems as such, but people were much interested in the sequence
of epical events. The abstracts which he himself drew up in the form
of arguments of several poems, show that he adapted himself to this
taste. We cannot collect from his words that he intended to express
any opinion of his own respecting the goodness or badness of the
cyclic poems.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_226"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_226">[226]</a></span> The gradual growth of a
contemptuous feeling towards the <i>scriptor cyclicus</i> (Horat. Ars.
Poetic. 136), which was not originally implied in the name, is well
set forth by Lange (Ueber die Kyklisch. Dicht. pp. 53-56).</p>

<p>Both Lange (pp. 36-41), however, and Ulrici (Geschichte des
Griech. Epos, 9te Vorles. p. 418) adopt another opinion with respect
to the cycle, which I think unsupported and inadmissible,—that the
several constituent poems were not received into it entire (<i>i. e.</i>
with only such changes as were requisite for a corrected text),
but cut down and abridged in such manner as to produce an <i>exact</i>
continuity of narrative. Lange even imagines that the cyclic Odyssey
was thus dealt with. But there seems no evidence to countenance this
theory, which would convert the Alexandrine literati from critics
into logographers. That the cyclic Iliad and Odyssey were the same
in the main (allowing for corrections of text) as the common Iliad
and Odyssey, is shown by the fact, that Proclus merely names them in
the series without giving any abstract of their contents: they were
too well known to render such a process necessary. Nor does either
the language of Proclus, or that of Cæcius as applied to Zenodotus,
indicate any transformation applied to the poets whose works are
described to have been brought together and put into a certain
order.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of Lange is founded upon the idea that the
(ἀκολουθία πραγμάτων) continuity of narrated events must necessarily
have been exact and without break, as if the whole constituted
one work. But this would not be possible, let the framers do what
they might: moreover, in the attempt, the individuality of all the
constituent poets must have been sacrificed, in such manner that it
would be absurd to discuss their separate merits.</p>

<p>The continuity of narrative in the Epic Cycle could not have
been more than approximate,—as complete as the poems composing it
would admit: nevertheless, it would be correct to say that the poems
were arranged in series upon this principle and upon no other. The
librarians might have arranged in like manner the vast mass of
tragedies in their possession (if they had chosen to do so) upon the
principle of sequence in the subjects: had they done so, the series
would have formed a <i>Tragic Cycle</i>.</p>

reasonably identified with the Thebaïs (Suidas, v. Ὅμηρος).</p>

<p id="Footnote_233"><span class="label"><a

γὰρ Ἀργείοισι πολεμήσας—τοῦτο μὲν, ῥαψῳδοὺς ἔπαυσε ἐν Σικυῶνι
ἀγωνίζεσθαι, τῶν Ὁμηρείων ἐπέων εἵνεκα, ὅτι Ἀργεῖοί τε καὶ Ἄργος τὰ
πολλὰ πάντα ὑμνέαται—τοῦτο δὲ, ἡρῴον γὰρ ἦν καὶ ἔστι ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἀγορᾷ
τῶν Σικυωνίων Ἀδρήστου τοῦ Ταλαοῦ, τοῦτον ἐπεθύμησε ὁ Κλεισθένης,
ἐόντα Ἀργεῖον, ἐκβαλεῖν ἐκ τῆς χώρης. Herodotus then goes on to
relate how Kleisthenês carried into effect his purpose of banishing
the hero Adrastus: first, he applied to the Delphian Apollo, for
permission to do so directly, and avowedly; next, on that permission
being refused, he made application to the Thebans, to allow him to
introduce into Sikyôn their hero Melanippus, the bitter enemy of
Adrastus in the old Theban legend; by their consent, he consecrated
a chapel to Melanippus in the most commanding part of the Sikyonian
agora, and then transferred to the newly-imported hero the rites and
festivals which had before been given to Adrastus.</p>

<p>Taking in conjunction all the points of this very curious tale,
I venture to think that the rhapsodes incurred the displeasure of
Kleisthenês by reciting, not the Homeric Iliad, but the <i>Homeric
Thebaïs and Epigoni</i>. The former does not answer the conditions of
the narrative: the latter fulfils them accurately.</p>

<p>1. It cannot be said, even by the utmost latitude of speech,
that, in the Iliad, “Little else is sung except Argos and the
Argeians,”—(“in illis ubique fere nonnisi Argos et Argivi
celebrantur,”)—is the translation of Schweighäuser: Argos is rarely
mentioned in it, and never exalted into any primary importance: the
Argeians, as inhabitants of Argos separately, are never noticed at
all: that name is applied in the Iliad, in common with the <i>Achæans</i>
and <i>Danaans</i>, only to the general body of Greeks,—and even applied
to them much less frequently than the name of <i>Achæans</i>.</p>

<p>2. Adrastus is twice, and only twice, mentioned in the Iliad, as
master of the wonderful horse Areion, and as father-in-law of Tydeus;
but he makes no figure in the poem, and attracts no interest.</p>

<p>Wherefore, though Kleisthenês might have been ever so much
incensed against Argos and Adrastus, there seems no reason why he
should have interdicted the rhapsodes from reciting the Iliad. On the
other hand, the Thebaïs and Epigoni could not fail to provoke him
especially. For,</p>

<p>1. Argos and its inhabitants were the grand subject of the poem,
and the proclaimed assailants in the expedition against Thêbes.
Though the poem itself is lost, the first line of it has been
preserved (Leutsch, Theb. Cycl. Reliq. p. 5; compare Sophoclês, Œd.
Col. 380 with Scholia),—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Ἄργος ἄειδε, θεὰ, πολυδίψιον, ἔνθεν ἄνακτες, etc.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">2. Adrastus was king of Argos, and the chief of the
expedition. It is therefore literally true, that Argos and the
Argeians were “the burden of the song” in these two poems.</p>

<p>To this we may add—</p>

<p>1. The rhapsodes would have the strongest motive to recite the
Thebaïs and Epigoni at Sikyôn, where Adrastus was worshipped and
enjoyed so vast a popularity, and where he even attracted to himself
the choric solemnities which in other towns were given to Dionysus.
</p>

<p>2. The means which Kleisthenês took to get rid of Adrastus
indicates a special reference to the Thebaïs: he invited from Thêbes
the hero Melanippus, the <i>Hector</i> of Thêbes, in that very poem.</p>

<p>For these reasons, I think we may conclude that the Ὁμήρεια ἔπη,
alluded to in this very illustrative story of Herodotus, are the
Thebaïs and the Epigoni, not the Iliad.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_234"><span class="label"><a

words in which Herodotus intimates his own dissent from the reigning
opinion, are treated as spurious by F. A. Wolf, and vindicated by
Schweighäuser: whether they be admitted or not, the general currency
of the opinion adverted to is equally evident.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_235"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_235">[235]</a></span> The Life of Homer, which passes
falsely under the name of Herodotus, contains a collection of these
different stories: it is supposed to have been written about the
second century after the Christian era, but the statements which it
furnishes are probably several of them as old as Ephorus (compare
also Proclus ap. Photium, c. 239).</p>

<p>The belief in the blindness of Homer is doubtless of far more
ancient date, since the circumstance appears mentioned in the Homeric
Hymn to the Delian Apollo where the bard of Chios, in some very
touching lines, recommends himself and his strains to the favor of
the Delian maidens employed in the worship of Apollo. This hymn is
cited by Thucydidês as unquestionably authentic, and he doubtless
accepted the lines as a description of the personal condition
and relations of the author of the Iliad and Odyssey (Thucyd.
iii. 104): Simonidês of Keôs also calls Homer a Chian (Frag. 69,
Schneidewin).</p>

<p>There were also tales which represented Homer as the contemporary,
the cousin, and the rival in recited composition, of Hesiod, who
(it was pretended) had vanquished him. See the Certamen Homeri et
Hesiodi, annexed to the works of the latter (p. 314, ed. Göttling;
and Plutarch, Conviv. Sept. Sapient. c. 10), in which also various
stories respecting the Life of Homer are scattered. The emperor
Hadrian consulted the Delphian oracle to know who Homer was: the
answer of the priestess reported him to be a native of Ithaca, the
son of Telemachus and Epikastê, daughter of Nestôr (Certamen Hom. et
Hes. p. 314). The author of this Certamen tells us that the authority
of the Delphian oracle deserves implicit confidence.</p>

<p>Hellanikus, Damastes, and Pherekydês traced both Homer and
Hesiod up to Orpheus, through a pedigree of ten generations (see
Sturz, Fragment. Hellanic. fr. 75-144; compare also Lobeck’s
remarks—<i>Aglaophamus</i>, p. 322—on the subject of these genealogies).
The computations of these authors earlier than Herodotus are of
value, because they illustrate the habits of mind in which Grecian
chronology began: the genealogy might be easily continued backward to
any length in the past. To trace Homer up to Orpheus, however, would
not have been consonant to the belief of the Homêrids.</p>

<p>The contentions of the different cities which disputed for the
birth of Homer, and, indeed, all the legendary anecdotes circulated
in antiquity respecting the poet, are copiously discussed in Welcker,
Der Epische Kyklos (pp. 194-199).</p>

<p id="Footnote_236"><span class="label"><a

Homer a divine parentage: a damsel of the isle of Ios, pregnant by
some god, was carried off by pirates to Smyrna, at the time of the
Ionic emigration, and there gave birth to the poet (Aristotel. ap.
Plutarch. Vit. Homer. p. 1059).</p>

<p>Plato seems to have considered Homer as having been an itinerant
rhapsode, poor and almost friendless (Republ. p. 600).</p>

<p>It seems by a passage of Plato (Phædrus, p. 252), that the

the Homêrid gens, and limit their functions to simple reciters,
denying that they ever composed songs or poems of their own. Yet
these <i>gentes</i>, such as the Euneidæ, the Lykomidæ, the Butadæ,
the Talthybiadæ, the descendants of Cheirôn at Peliôn, etc., the
Hesychidæ (Schol. Sophocl. Œdip. Col. 489), (the acknowledged
parallels of the Homêridæ), may be surely all considered as belonging
to the earliest known elements of Grecian history: rarely, at least,
if ever, can such gens, with its tripartite character of civil,
religious, and professional, be shown to have commenced at any recent
period. And in the early times, composer and singer were one person:
often at least, though probably not always, the bard combined both
functions. The Homeric ἀοιδὸς sings his own compositions; and it
is reasonable to imagine that many of the early Homêrids did the
same.</p>

gives the same meaning to the name <i>Homer</i>); and the recurrence
of many Vyasas,—many individuals who new-modelled the Hindu
scriptures,—has nothing in it that is improbable, except the fabulous
intervals by which their labors are separated.” Individual authorship
and the thirst of personal distinction, are in this case also buried
under one great and common name, as in the case of Homer.</p>

descended from Æneas. We should have been glad to know the grounds of
the very low date assigned by Theopompus and Euphoriôn.</p>

<p>The pseudo-Herodotus, in his life of Homer, puts the birth of the
poet one hundred and sixty-eight years after the Trojan war.</p>

Ponticus affirmed that Lykurgus had brought into Peloponnêsus the
Homeric poems, which had before been unknown out of Ionia. The
supposed epoch of Lykurgus has sometimes been employed to sustain the
date here assigned to the Homeric poems; but everything respecting
Lykurgus is too doubtful to serve as evidence in other inquiries.</p>

<p id="Footnote_242"><span class="label"><a

this sort, some very short, consisting only of a few lines,—others of
considerable length. The Hymn (or, rather, one of the two hymns) to
Apollo is cited by Thucydidês as the Proœm of Apollo.</p>

<p>The Hymns to Aphroditê, Apollo, Hermês, Dêmêtêr, and Dionysus,
are genuine epical narratives. Hermann (Præf. ad Hymn. p. lxxxix.)
pronounces the Hymn to Aphroditê to be the oldest and most genuine:
portions of the Hymn to Apollo (Herm. p. xx.) are also very old, but
both that hymn and the others are largely interpolated. His opinion
respecting these interpolations, however, is disputed by Franke
(Præfat. ad Hymn. Homeric. p. ix-xix.); and the distinction between
what is genuine and what is spurious, depends upon criteria not very
distinctly assignable. Compare Ulrici, Gesch. der Ep. Poes. pp.
385-391.</p>

position (Odyss. i. 155; iii. 267; viii. 490; xxi. 330; Achilles in

<p>There are some good observations on this point in Näke’s comments
on Chœrilus, ch. viii. p. 59:—</p>

<p>“Habet hoc epica poesis, vera illa, cujus perfectissimam normam
agnoscimus Homericam—habet hoc proprium, ut non in possessione
virorum eruditorum, sed quasi viva sit et coram populo recitanda:
ut cum populo crescat, et si populus Deorum et antiquorum heroum
facinora, quod præcipium est epicæ poeseos argumentum, audire et
secum repetere dedidicerit, obmutescat. Id vero tum factum est in
Græciâ, quum populus eâ ætate, quam pueritiam dicere possis, peractâ,
partim ad res serias tristesque, politicas maxime—easque multo, quam
antea, impeditiores—abstrahebatur: partim epicæ poeseos pertæsus,
ex aliis poeseos generibus, quæ tum nascebantur, novum et diversum
oblectamenti genus primo præsagire, sibi, deinde haurire, cœpit.”</p>

<p>Näke remarks, too, that the “splendidissima et propria Homericæ
poeseos ætas, ea quæ sponte quasi suâ inter populum et quasi cum
populo viveret,” did not reach below Peisistratus. It did not, I
think, reach even so low as that period.</p>

Sympos. iii. 6. Οἶσθά τι οὖν ἔθνος ἠλιθιώτερον ῥαψῴδων; ... Δῆλον γὰρ
ὅτι τὰς ὑπονοίας οὐκ ἐπίστανται. Σὺ δὲ Στησιμβρότῳ τε καὶ Ἀναξιμάνδρῳ
καὶ ἄλλοις πολλοῖς πολὺ δέδωκας ἀργύριον, ὥστε οὐδέν σε τῶν πολλοῦ
ἀξίων λέληθε.</p>

<p>These ὑπονοῖαι are the hidden meanings, or allegories, which a
certain set of philosophers undertook to discover in Homer, and which
the rhapsodes were no way called upon to study.</p>

<p>The Platonic dialogue, called Iôn, ascribes to Iôn the double
function of a rhapsode, or impressive reciter, and a critical
expositor of the poet (Isokratês also indicates the same double
character, in the rhapsodes of his time,—Panathenaic, p. 240); but
it conveys no solid grounds for a mean estimate of the class of
rhapsodes, while it attests remarkably the striking effect produced
by their recitation (c. 6, p. 535). That this class of men came
to combine the habit of expository comment on the poet with their
original profession of reciting, proves the tendencies of the age;
probably, it also brought them into rivalry with the philosophers.</p>

<p>The grounds taken by Aristotle (Problem. xxx. 10; compare Aul.
Gellius, xx. 14) against the actors, singers, musicians, etc. of his
time, are more serious, and have more the air of truth.</p>

<p>If it be correct in Lehrs (de Studiis Aristarchi, Diss. ii. p. 46)
to identify those early glossographers of Homer, whose explanations
the Alexandrine critics so severely condemned, with the rhapsodes,
this only proves that the rhapsodes had come to undertake a double
duty, of which their predecessors before Solôn would never have
dreamed.</p>

Gedichte, pp. 340-406, which collects all the facts respecting the
aœdi and the rhapsodes. Unfortunately, the ascertained points are
very few.</p>

<p>The laurel branch in the hand of the singer or reciter (for the
two expressions are often confounded) seems to have been peculiar
to the recitation of Homer and Hesiod (Hesiod, Theog. 30: Schol.
ad Aristophan. Nub. 1367. Pausan. x. 7, 2). “Poemata omne genus
(says Apuleius, Florid. p. 122, Bipont.) apta <i>virgæ</i>, lyræ, socco,
cothurno.”</p>

<p>Not only Homer and Hesiod, but also Archilochus, were recited by
rhapsodes (Athenæ, xii. 620; also Plato, Legg. ii. p. 658). Consult,
besides, Nitzsch, De Historiâ Homeri, Fascic. 2, p. 114, <i>seq.</i>,
respecting the rhapsodes; and O. Müller, History of the Literature of
Ancient Greece, ch. iv. s. 3.</p>

<p>The ideas of singing and speech are, however, often
confounded, in reference to any verse solemnly and emphatically
delivered (Thucydid. ii. 53)—φάσκοντες οἱ πρεσβύτεροι πάλαι <em
class="gesperrt">ᾄδεσθαι</em>, Ἥξει Δωριακὸς πόλεμος καὶ λοιμὸς ἅμ᾽
αὐτῷ. And the rhapsodes are said to <i>sing</i> Homer (Plato, Eryxias, c.
13; Hesych. v. Βραυρωνίοις); Strabo (i. p. 18) has a good passage
upon song and speech.</p>

<p>William Grimm (Deutsche Heldensage, p. 373) supposes the ancient
German heroic romances to have been recited or declaimed in a similar
manner with a simple accompaniment of the harp, as the Servian heroic
lays are even at this time delivered.</p>

<p>Fauriel also tells us, respecting the French Carlovingian Epic
(Romans de Chevalerie, Revue des Deux Mondes, xiii. p. 559):
“The romances of the 12th and 13th centuries were really sung:
the <i>jongleur</i> invited his audience to hear a <i>belle chanson
d’histoire</i>,—‘le mot chanter ne manque jamais dans la formule
initiale,’—and it is to be understood literally: the music was simple
and intermittent, more like a recitative; the jongleur carried a
rebek, or violin with three strings, an Arabic instrument; when he
wished to rest his voice, he played an air or ritournelle upon this;
he went thus about from place to place, and the romances had no
existence among the people, except through the aid and recitation of
these jongleurs.”</p>

<p>It appears that there had once been rhapsodic exhibitions at the
festivals of Dionysus, but they were discontinued (Klearchus ap.
Athenæ. vii. p. 275)—probably superseded by the dithyramb and the
tragedy.</p>

<p>The etymology of ῥαψῳδὸς is a disputed point: Welcker traces it to
ῥάβδος, most critics derive it from ῥάπτειν ἀοιδὴν, which O. Müller
explains “to denote the coupling together of verses without any
considerable divisions or pauses,—the even, unbroken, continuous flow
of the epic poem,” as contrasted with the strophic or choric periods
(<i>l. c.</i>).</p>

<p id="Footnote_248"><span class="label"><a

The κίθαρις, ἀοιδὴ, ὀρχηθμὸς, are constantly put together in that
hymn: evidently, the instrumental accompaniment was essential to the
hymns at the Ionic festival. Compare also the Hymn to Hermês (430),
where the function ascribed to the Muses can hardly be understood to
include non-musical recitation. The Hymn to Hermês is more recent
than Terpander, inasmuch as it mentions the seven strings of the
lyre, v. 50.</p>

<p>Stesander at the Pythian festivals sang the Homeric battles, with
a harp accompaniment of his own composition (Athenæ. xiv. p. 638).</p>

Homeric poems at Athens, chiefly at the Panathenaic festival, are
Isokratês, Panegyric. p. 74; Lycurgus contra Leocrat. p. 161; Plato,
Hipparch. p. 228; Diogen. Laërt. Vit. Solon. i. 57.</p>

<p>Inscriptions attest that rhapsodizing continued in great esteem,
down to a late period of the historical age, both at Chios and
Teôs, especially the former: it was the subject of competition by
trained youth, and of prizes for the victor, at periodical religious
solemnities: see Corp. Inscript. Boeckh, No. 2214-3088.</p>

<p>The evidences of early writing among the Greeks, and of written
poems even anterior to Homer, may be seen collected in Kreuser
(Vorfragen ueber Homeros, pp. 127-159, Frankfort, 1828). His proofs
appear to me altogether inconclusive. Nitzsch maintains the same
opinion (Histor. Homeri, Fasc. i. sect. xi. xvii. xviii.),—in my
opinion, not more successfully: nor does Franz (Epigraphicê Græc.
Introd. s. iv.) produce any new arguments.</p>

<p>I do not quite subscribe to Mr. Knight’s language, when he
says that <i>there is nothing wonderful</i> in the long preservation
of the Homeric poems <i>unwritten</i>. It is enough to maintain that
the existence, and practical use of long manuscripts, by all the
rhapsodes, under the condition and circumstances of the 8th and 9th
centuries among the Greeks, would be a greater wonder.</p>

<p>I transcribe, from the interesting Discours of M. Fauriel
(prefixed to his Chants Populaires de la Grèce Moderne, Paris 1824),
a few particulars respecting the number, the mnemonic power, and the
popularity of those itinerant singers or rhapsodes who frequent the
festivals or <i>paneghyris</i> of modern Greece: it is curious to learn
that this profession is habitually exercised by <i>blind</i> men (p. xc.
<i>seq.</i>).</p>

<p>“Les aveugles exercent en Grèce une profession qui les rend non
seulement agréables, mais nécessaires; le caractère, l’imagination,
et la condition du peuple, étant ce qu’ils sont: c’est la profession
de chanteurs ambulans.... Ils sont dans l’usage, tant sur le
continent que dans les îles, de la Grèce, d’apprendre par cœur le
plus grand nombre qu’ils peuvent de chansons populaires de tout
genre et de toute époque. Quelques uns finissent par en savoir une
quantité prodigieuse, et tous en savent beaucoup. Avec ce trésor
dans leur mémoire, ils sont toujours en marche, traversent la
Grèce en tout sens; ils s’en vont de ville en ville, de village en
village, chantant à l’auditoire qui se forme aussitôt autour d’eux,
partout où ils se montrent, celles de leurs chansons qu’ils jugent
convenir le mieux, soit à la localité, soit à la circonstance, et
reçoivent une petite rétribution qui fait tout leur revenu. Ils ont
l’air de chercher de préférence, en tout lieu, la partie la plus
inculte de la population, qui en est toujours la plus curieuse, la
plus avide d’impressions, et la moins difficile dans le choix de
ceux qui leur sont offertes. Les Turcs seuls ne les écoutent pas.
C’est aux réunions nombreuses, aux fêtes de village connues sous le
nom de <i>Paneghyris</i>, que ces chanteurs ambulans accourent le plus
volontiers. Ils chantent en s’accompagnant d’un instrument à cordes
que l’on touche avec un archet, et qui est exactement l’ancienne lyre
des Grecs, dont il a conservé le nom comme la forme.</p>

<p>“Cette lyre, pour être entière, doit avoir cinq cordes: mais
souvent elle n’en a que deux ou trois, dont les sons, comme il est
aisé de présumer, n’ont rien de bien harmonieux. Les chanteurs
aveugles vont ordinairement isolés, et chacun d’eux chante à part des
autres: mais quelquefois aussi ils se réunissent par groupes de deux
ou de trois, pour dire ensemble les mêmes chansons.... Ces modernes
rhapsodes doivent être divisés en deux classes. Les uns (et ce sont,
selon toute apparence, les plus nombreux) se bornent à la function de
recueillir, d’apprendre par cœur, et de mettre en circulation, des
pièces qu’ils n’ont point composées. Les autres (et ce sont ceux qui
forment l’ordre le plus distingué de leur corps), à cette fonction de
répétiteurs et de colporteurs des poésies d’autrui, joignent celle
de poëtes, et ajoutent à la masse des chansons apprises d’autres
chants de leur façon.... Ces rhapsodes aveugles sont les nouvellistes
et les historiens, en même temps que les poëtes du peuple, en cela
parfaitement semblables aux rhapsodes anciens de la Grèce.”</p>

<p>To pass to another country—Persia, once the great rival of
Greece: “The Kurroglian rhapsodes are called <i>Kurroglou-Khans</i>,
from <i>khaunden</i>, to sing. Their duty is, to know by heart all the
<i>mejjlisses</i> (meetings) of Kurroglou, narrate them, or sing them
with the accompaniment of the favorite instrument of Kurroglou, the
chungur, or sitar, a three-stringed guitar. Ferdausi has also his
<i>Shah-nama-Khans</i>, and the prophet Mohammed his <i>Koran Khans</i>. The
memory of those singers is truly astonishing. At every request,
they recite in one breath for some hours, without stammering,
beginning the tale at the passage or verse pointed out by the
hearers.” (Specimens of the Popular Poetry of Persia, as found in the
Adventures and Improvisations of Kurroglou, the Bandit Minstrel of
Northern Persia, by Alexander Chodzko: London 1842, Introd. p. 13)</p>

Fragm. pp. 27-29, gives a considerable list of the Homeric passages
cited by ancient authors, but not found either in the Iliad or
Odyssey. It is hardly to be doubted, however, that many of these
passages belonged to other epic poems which passed under the name of
Homer. Welcker (Der Episch. Kyklus, pp. 20-133) enforces this opinion
very justly, and it harmonizes with his view of the name of Homer as
coextensive with the whole Epic cycle.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_256"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_256">[256]</a></span> See this argument strongly
maintained in Giese (Ueber den Æolischen Dialekt, sect. 14. p.
160, <i>seqq.</i>). He notices several other particulars in the Homeric
language,—the plenitude and variety of interchangeable grammatical
forms,—the numerous metrical licenses, set right by appropriate oral
intonations,—which indicate a language as yet not constrained by the
fixity of written authority.</p>

<p>The same line of argument is taken by O. Müller (History of the
Literature of Ancient Greece, ch. iv. s. 5).</p>

<p>Giese has shown also, in the same chapter, that all the
manuscripts of Homer mentioned in the Scholia, were written in the
Ionic alphabet (with Η and Ω as marks for the long vowels, and no
special mark for the rough breathing), in so far as the special
citations out of them enable us to verify.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_257"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_257">[257]</a></span> Nitzsch and Welcker argue,
that because the Homeric poems were <i>heard</i> with great delight and
interest, therefore the first rudiments of the art of writing, even
while beset by a thousand mechanical difficulties, would be employed
to record them. I cannot adopt this opinion, which appears to me to
derive all its plausibility from our present familiarity with reading
and writing. The first step from the recited to the written poem
is really one of great violence, as well as useless for any want
then actually felt. I much more agree with Wolf when he says: “Diu
enim illorum hominum vita et simplicitas nihil admodum habuit, quod
scripturâ dignum videretur: in aliis omnibus occupati agunt illi,
quæ posteri scribunt, vel (ut de quibusdam populis accepimus) etiam
monstratam operam hanc spernunt tanquam indecori otii: carmina autem
quæ pangunt, longo usu sic ore fundere et excipere consueverunt, ut
cantu et recitatione cum maxime vigentia deducere ad mutas notas, ex
illius ætatis sensu nihil aliud esset, quam perimere ea et vitali vi
ac spiritu privare.” (Prolegom. s. xv. p. 59.)</p>

<p>Some good remarks on this subject are to be found in William
Humboldt’s Introduction to his elaborate treatise <i>Ueber die
Kawi-Sprache</i>, in reference to the oral tales current among the
Basques. He, too, observes how great and repulsive a proceeding it
is, to pass at first from verse sung, or recited, to verse written;
implying that the words are conceived detached from the <i>Vortrag</i>,
the accompanying music, and the surrounding and sympathizing
assembly. The Basque tales have no charm for the people themselves,
when put in Spanish words and read (Introduction, sect. xx. p.
258-259).</p>

<p>Unwritten prose tales, preserved in the memory, and said to be
repeated nearly in the same words from age to age, are mentioned
by Mariner, in the Tonga Islands (Mariner’s Account, vol. ii. p.

Hellenici, vol. i. pp. 368-373) treats it as a matter of <i>certainty</i>
that Archilochus and Alkman <i>wrote</i> their poems. I am not aware of
any evidence for announcing this as positively known,—except, indeed,
an admission of Wolf, which is, doubtless, good as an <i>argumentum ad
hominem</i>, but is not to be received as proof (Wolf, Proleg. p. 50).
The evidences mentioned by Mr. Clinton (p. 368) certainly cannot be
regarded as proving anything to the point.</p>

<p id="Footnote_259"><span class="label"><a

Skalds were preserved orally for a period longer than two
centuries,—P. A. Müller thinks very much longer,—before they were
collected, or embodied in written story by Snorro and Sæmund (Lange,
Untersuchungen über die Gesch. der Nördischen Heldensage. p. 98;
also, Introduct. pp. xx-xxviii). He confounds, however, often, the
preservation of the songs from old time,—with the question, whether
they have or have not an historical basis.</p>

<p>And there were, doubtless, many old bards and rhapsodes in ancient
Greece, of whom the same might be said which Saxo Grammaticus affirms
of an Englishman named Lucas, that he was “literis quidem tenuiter
instructus, sed historiarum scientiâ apprime eruditus.” (Dahlmann,
Historische Forschungen, vol. ii. p. 176.)</p>

<p id="Footnote_260"><span class="label"><a

and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself for small earnings and good
cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment; the Iliad he made
for the men, the Odysseus for the other sex. These loose songs were
not collected together into the form of an epic poem until 500 years
after.”</p>

<p>Such is the naked language in which Wolf’s main hypothesis had
been previously set forth by Bentley, in his “Remarks on a late
Discourse of Freethinking, by Phileleutherus Lipsiensis,” published
in 1713: the passage remained unaltered in the seventh edition of
that treatise published in 1737. See Wolf’s Proleg. xxvii. p. 115.</p>

<p>The same hypothesis may be seen more amply developed, partly in
the work of Wolfs pupil and admirer, William Müller, <i>Homerische
Vorschule</i> (the second edition of which was published at Leipsic,
1836, with an excellent introduction and notes by Baumgarten-Crusius,
adding greatly to the value of the original work by its dispassionate
review of the whole controversy), partly in two valuable
Dissertations of Lachmann, published in the Philological Transactions
of the Berlin Academy for 1837 and 1841.</p>

Ælian (V. II. xiii. 14), who mentions both the introduction of the
Homeric poems into Peloponnesus by Lykurgus, and the compilation by
Peisistratus, can hardly be considered as adding to the value of
the testimony: still less, Libanius and Suidas. What we learn is,
that some literary and critical men of the Alexandrine age (more or
fewer, as the case may be; but Wolf exaggerates when he talks of an
<i>unanimous</i> conviction) spoke of Peisistratus as having first put
together the fractional parts of the Iliad and Odyssey into entire
poems.</p>

lächerlich vor, wenn ich noch immer die Möglichkeit gelten lasse,
dass unsere Ilias in dem gegenwärtigen Zusammenhange der bedeutenden
Theile, und nicht blos der wenigen bedeutendsten, jemals vor der
Arbeit des Pisistratus gedacht worden sey.” (Lachmann, Fernere
Betrachtungen über die Ilias, sect. xxviii. p. 32; Abhandlungen
Berlin. Academ. 1841.) How far this admission—that for the <i>few most
important</i> portions of the Iliad, there <i>did</i> exist an established
order of succession prior to Peisistratus—is intended to reach, I
do not know; but the language of Lachmann goes farther than either
Wolf or William Müller. (See Wolf, Prolegomen. pp. cxli-cxlii, and
W. Müller, Homerische Vorschule, Abschnitt vii. pp. 96, 98, 100,
102.) The latter admits that neither Peisistratus nor the Diaskeuasts
could have made any considerable changes in the Iliad and Odyssey,
either in the way of addition or of transposition; the poems as
aggregates being too well known, and the Homeric vein of invention
too completely extinct, to admit of such novelties.</p>

<p>I confess, I do not see how these last-mentioned admissions can
be reconciled with the main doctrine of Wolf, in so far as regards
Peisistratus.</p>

<p>Respecting Hipparchus, son of Peisistratus, the Pseudo-Plato tells
us (in the dialogue so called, p. 228),—καὶ τὰ Ὁμήρου ἔπη πρῶτος
ἐκόμισεν εἰς τὴν γῆν ταυτηνὶ, καὶ ἠνάγκασε τοὺς ῥαψῳδοὺς Παναθηναίοις
<em class="gesperrt">ἐξ ὑπολήψεως</em> ἐφεξῆς αὐτὰ διϊέναι, <em
class="gesperrt">ὥσπερ νῦν ἔτι</em> οἵδε ποιοῦσι.</p>

<p>These words have provoked multiplied criticisms from all the
learned men who have touched upon the theory of the Homeric poems,—to
determine what was the practice which Solon found existing, and what
was the change which he introduced. Our information is too scanty
to pretend to certainty, but I think the explanation of Hermann the
most satisfactory (“Quid sit <em class="gesperrt">ὑποβολὴ</em> et <em
class="gesperrt">ὑποβλήδεν</em>.”—<i>Opuscula</i>, tom. v. p. 300, tom.
vii. p. 162).</p>

<p>Ὑποβολεὺς is the technical term for the prompter at a theatrical
representation (Plutarch, Præcept. gerend. Reip. p. 813); ὑποβολὴ
and ὑποβάλλειν have corresponding meanings, of aiding the memory of
a speaker and keeping him in accordance with a certain standard, in
possession of the prompter: see the words ἐξ ὑποβολῆς, Xenophon.
Cyropæd. iii. 3, 37. Ὑποβολὴ, therefore, has no necessary connection
with a series of rhapsodes, but would apply just as much to one
alone; although it happens in this case to be brought to bear
upon several in succession. Ὑπόληψις, again, means “the taking up
in succession of one rhapsode by another:” though the two words,
therefore, have not the same meaning, yet the proceeding described
in the two passages, in reference both to Solôn and Hipparchus,
appears to be in substance the same,—<i>i. e.</i> to insure, by compulsory
supervision, a correct and orderly recitation by the successive
rhapsodes who went through the different parts of the poem.</p>

<p>There is good reason to conclude from this passage that the
rhapsodes before Solôn were guilty both of negligence and of omission
in their recital of Homer, but no reason to imagine either that they
transposed the books, or that the legitimate order was not previously
recognized.</p>

<p>The appointment of a systematic ὑποβολεὺς, or prompter, plainly
indicates the existence of complete manuscripts.</p>

<p>The direction of Solôn, that Homer should be rhapsodized under
the security of a prompter with his manuscript, appears just the
same as that of the orator Lykurgus in reference to Æschylus,
Sophoklês, and Euripidês (Pseudo-Plutarch. Vit. x. Rhetor. Lycurgi
Vit.)—εἰσήνεγκε δὲ καὶ νόμους—ὡς χαλκᾶς εἰκόνας ἀναθεῖναι τῶν ποιητῶν
Αἰσχύλου, Σοφοκλέους, Εὐριπίδου, καὶ τὰς τραγῳδίας αὐτῶν ἐν κοινῷ
γραψαμένους φυλάττειν, καὶ τὸν τῆς πόλεως γραμματέα παραναγιγνώσκειν
τοῖς ὑποκρινομένοις· οὐ γὰρ ἐξῆν αὐτὰς (ἄλλως) ὑποκρίνεσθαι. The word
ἄλλως, which occurs last but one, is introduced by the conjecture
of Grysar, who has cited and explained the above passage of the
Pseudo-Plutarch in a valuable dissertation—<i>De Græcorum Tragœdiâ,
qualis fuit circa tempora Demosthenis</i> (Cologne, 1830). All the
critics admit the text as it now stands to be unintelligible, and
various corrections have been proposed, among which that of Grysar
seems the best. From his Dissertation, I transcribe the following
passage, which illustrates the rhapsodizing of Homer ἐξ ὑποβολῆς:—</p>

<p>“Quum histriones fabulis interpolandis ægre abstinerent,
Lycurgus legem supra indicatam eo tulit consilio, ut recitationes
histrionum cum publico illo exemplo omnino congruas redderet. Quod
ut assequeretur, constituit, ut dum fabulæ in scenâ recitarentur,
scriba publicus simul exemplum civitatis inspiceret, juxta sive in
theatro sive in postscenio sedens. Hæc enim verbi παραναγιγνώσκειν
est significatio, posita præcipue in præpositione παρὰ, ut idem sit,
quod <i>contra</i> sive <i>juxta</i> legere; id quod faciunt ii, <i>qui lecta ab
altero vel recitata cum suis conferre cupiunt</i>.” (Grysar, p. 7.)</p>

<p id="Footnote_265"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_265">[265]</a></span> That the Iliad or Odyssey were
ever recited with all the parts entire, at any time anterior to
Solôn, is a point which Ritschl denies (Die Alexandrin. Bibliothek,
pp. 67-70). He thinks that before Solôn, they were always recited in
parts, and without any fixed order among the parts. Nor did Solôn
determine (as he thinks) the order of the parts: he only checked
the license of the rhapsodes as to the recitation of the separate
books: it was Pesistratus, who, with the help of Onomakritus and
others, first settled the order of the parts and bound each poem into
a whole, with some corrections and interpolations. Nevertheless,
he admits that the parts were originally composed by the same
poet, and adapted to form a whole amongst each other: but this
primitive entireness (he asserts) was only maintained as a sort of
traditional belief, never realized in recitation, and never reduced
to an obvious, unequivocal, and permanent fact,—until the time of
Peisistratus.</p>

<p>There is no sufficient ground, I think, for denying all entire
recitation previous to Solôn, and we only interpose a new difficulty,
both grave and gratuitous, by doing so.</p>

<p id="Footnote_266"><span class="label"><a

contained nine thousand one hundred verses, as we learn from the
Tabula Iliaca: yet Proklus assigns to it only four books. The Ilias
Minor had <i>four</i> books, the Cyprian Verses <i>eleven</i>, though we do not
know the number of lines in either.</p>

<p>Nitzsch states it as a certain matter of fact, that Arktinus
recited his own poem <i>alone</i>, though it was too long to admit of his
doing so without interruption. (See his Vorrede to the second vol. of
the Odyssey, p. xxiv.) There is no evidence for this assertion, and
it appears to me highly improbable.</p>

<p>In reference to the Romances of the Middle Ages, belonging to
the Cycle of the Round Table, M. Fauriel tells us that the German
<i>Perceval</i> has nearly twenty-five thousand verses (more than half
as long again as the Iliad); the <i>Perceval</i> of Christian of Troyes,
probably more; the German <i>Tristan</i>, of Godfrey of Strasburg, has
more than twenty-three thousand; sometimes, the poem is begun by one
author, and continued by another. (Fauriel, Romans de Chevalerie,
Revue des Deux Mondes, t. xiii. pp. 695-697.)</p>

<p>The ancient unwritten poems of the Icelandic Skalds are as much
lyric as epic: the longest of them does not exceed eight hundred
lines, and they are for the most part much shorter (Untersuchungen

on Plautus edited by Ritschl (see Die Alexandrinische Bibliothek,
p. 4) specifies the four persons (Onomakritus was one) employed on
the task. Ritschl fancies that it served as a sort of Vulgate for
the text of the Alexandrine critics, who named specially other MSS.
(of Chios, Sinôpê, Massalia, etc.) only when they diverged from this
Vulgate: he thinks, also, that it formed the original from whence
those other MSS. were first drawn, which are called in the Homeric
Scholia αἱ κοιναὶ, κοινότεραι (pp. 59-60).</p>

<p id="Footnote_270"><span class="label"><a

of coloring, and the antiquity of coloring, which pervade the Homeric
poems; also, the strong line by which they stand distinguished from
the other Greek poets: “Immo congruunt in iis omnia ferme in idem
ingenium, in eosdem mores, in eandem formam sentiendi et loquendi.”
(Prolegom. p. cclxv; compare p. cxxxviii.)</p>

<p>He thinks, indeed, that this harmony was <i>restored</i> by the ability
and care of Aristarchus, (“mirificum illum concentum revocatum
Aristarcho imprimis debemus.”) This is a very exaggerated estimate
of the interference of Aristarchus: but at any rate the <i>concentus</i>
itself was ancient and original, and Aristarchus only <i>restored</i>
it, when it had been spoiled by intervening accidents; at least, if
we are to construe <i>revocatum</i> strictly, which, perhaps, is hardly
consistent with Wolf’s main theory.</p>

<p>Lachmann, after having dissected the two thousand two hundred
lines in the Iliad, between the beginning of the eleventh book, and
line five hundred and ninety of the fifteenth, into four songs, “in
the highest degree different in their spirit,” (“ihrem Geiste nach
höchst verschiedene Lieder,”) tells us that whosoever thinks this
difference of spirit inconsiderable,—whosoever does not feel it at
once when pointed out,—whosoever can believe that the parts as they
stand now belong to one artistically constructed Epos,—“will do well
not to trouble himself any more either with my criticisms or with
epic poetry, because he is too weak to understand anything about
it,” (“weil er zu schwach ist etwas darin zu verstehen:”) Fernere

<p>On the contrary, Ulrici, after having shown (or tried to show)
that the composition of Homer satisfies perfectly, in the main,
all the exigencies of an artistic epic,—adds, that this will make
itself at once evident to all those who have any sense of artistical
symmetry; but that, for those to whom that sense is wanting,
no conclusive demonstration can be given. He warns the latter,
however, that they are not to deny the existence of that which
their shortsighted vision cannot distinguish, for everything cannot
be made clear to children, which the mature man sees through at a
glance (Ulrici, Geschichte des Griechischen Epos, Part i. ch. vii.

insanity of the Wolfian school, obvious even to the “homunculus e

unequivocal language, the compact and artful structure of the
Odyssey. Against this positive internal evidence, he sets the general
presumption, that no such constructive art can possibly have belonged
to a poet of the age of Homer: “De Odysseâ maxime, cujus admirabilis
summa et compages pro præclarissimo monumento Græci ingenii habenda
est.... Unde fit ut Odysseam nemo, cui omnino priscus vates placeat,
nisi perlectam e manu deponere queat. At illa ars id ipsum est, quod
<i>vix ac ne vix quidem cadere</i> videtur in vatem, singulas tantum
rhapsodias decantantem,” etc. (Prolegomen. pp. cxviii-cxx; compare

<p id="Footnote_281"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_281">[281]</a></span> Lachmann seems to admit one
case in which the composer of one song manifests cognizance of
another song, and a disposition to give what will form a sequel to
it. His fifteenth song (the Patrokleia) lasts from xv. 592 down to
the end of the 17th book: the sixteenth song (including the four next
books, from eighteen to twenty-two inclusive) is a continuation of
the fifteenth, but by a different poet. (Fernere Betrachtungen über
die Ilias, Abhandl. Berlin. Acad. 1841, sect. xxvi. xxviii. xxix. pp.
24, 34, 42.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_282"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_282">[282]</a></span> The advocates of the Wolfian
theory, appear to feel the difficulties which beset it; for their
language is wavering in respect to these supposed primary constituent
atoms. Sometimes Lachmann tells us, that the original pieces were
much finer poetry than the Iliad as we now read it; at another time,
that it cannot be now discovered what they originally were: nay, he
farther admits, (as remarked in the preceding note,) that the poet of
the sixteenth song had cognizance of the fifteenth.</p>

<p>But if it be granted that the original constituent songs were so
composed, though by different poets, as that the more recent were
adapted to the earlier with more or less dexterity and success,
this brings us into totally different conditions of the problem. It
is a virtual surrender of the Wolfian hypothesis, which, however,
Lachmann both means to defend, and does defend with ability; though
his vindication of it has, to my mind, only the effect of exposing
its inherent weakness by carrying it out into something detailed and
positive. I will add, in respect to his Dissertations, so instructive
as a microscopic examination of the poem,—1. That I find myself
constantly dissenting from that critical feeling, on the strength
of which he cuts out parts as interpolations, and discovers traces
of the hand of distinct poets; 2. That his objections against the
continuity of the narrative are often founded upon lines which the
ancient scholiasts and Mr. Payne Knight had already pronounced to be
interpolations; 3. That such of his objections as are founded upon
lines undisputed, admit in many cases of a complete and satisfactory
reply.</p>

<p>After having pointed out certain discrepancies which he maintains
to prove different composing hands, he adds: “Nevertheless, we must
be careful not to regard the single constituent songs in this part of
the poem as being distinct and separable in a degree equal to those
in the first half; for they all with one accord harmonize in one
particular circumstance, which, with reference to the story of the
Iliad, is not less important even than the anger of Achilles, viz.
that the three most distinguished heroes, Agamemnôn, Odysseus, and
Diomêdês, all become disabled throughout the whole duration of the
battles.”</p>

that a man of so much genius and power of thought as M. Benjamin
Constant, should have imagined the original Iliad to have concluded
with the death of Patroclus, on the ground that Achilles then becomes
reconciled with Agamemnôn. See the review of B. Constant’s work,
De la Religion, etc., by O. Müller, in the Kleine Schriften of the

<p id="Footnote_288"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_288">[288]</a></span> He appears as the mediator
between the insulted Achilles and the Greeks, manifesting kindly
sympathies for the latter without renouncing his fidelity to the
former. The wounded Machaon, an object of interest to the whole camp,
being carried off the field by Nestor,—Achilles, looking on from
his distant ship, sends Patroclus to inquire whether it be really
Machaon; which enables Nestor to lay before Patroclus the deplorable
state of the Grecian host, as a motive to induce him and Achilles
again to take arms. The compassionate feelings of Patroclus being
powerfully touched, he is hastening to enforce upon Achilles the
urgent necessity of giving help, when he meets Eurypylus crawling out
of the field, helpless with a severe wound, and imploring his succor.
He supports the wounded warrior to his tent, and ministers to his
suffering; but before this operation is fully completed, the Grecian
host has been totally driven back, and the Trojans are on the point
of setting fire to the ships: Patroclus then hurries to Achilles to
proclaim the desperate peril which hangs over them all, and succeeds
in obtaining his permission to take the field at the head of the
Myrmidons. The way in which Patroclus is kept present to the hearer,
as a prelude to his brilliant but short-lived display, when he comes
forth in arms,—the contrast between his characteristic gentleness
and the ferocity of Achilles,—and the natural train of circumstances
whereby he is made the vehicle of reconciliation on the part of his
offended friend, and rescue to his imperiled countrymen,—all these
exhibit a degree of epical skill, in the author of the primitive
Achillêis, to which nothing is found parallel in the added books of
the Iliad.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_289"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_289">[289]</a></span> Observe, for example, the
following passages:—</p>

<p>1. Achilles, standing on the prow of his ship, sees the general
army of Greeks undergoing defeat by the Trojans, and also sees
Nestor conveying in his chariot a wounded warrior from the field. He
sends Patroclus to find out who the wounded man is: in calling forth
Patroclus, he says (xi. 607),—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Δῖε Μενοιτιάδη τῷ ᾽μῷ κεχαρισμένε θυμῷ,</p>
<p class="i0">Νῦν οἴω περὶ γούνατ᾽ ἐμὰ στήσεσθαι Ἀχαιοὺς</p>
<p class="i0">Λισσομένους· χρείω γὰρ ἱκάνεται οὔκετ᾽ ἀνεκτός.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">Heyne, in his comment, asks the question, not
unnaturally, “Pœnituerat igitur asperitatis erga priorem legationem,
an homo arrogans expectaverat alteram ad se missam iri?” I answer,
neither one nor the other: the words imply that he had received <i>no
embassy</i> at all. He is still the same Achilles who in the first book
paced alone by the seashore, devouring his own soul under a sense
of bitter affront, and praying to Thetis to aid his revenge: this
revenge is now about to be realized, and he hails its approach with
delight. But if we admit the embassy of the ninth book to intervene,
the passage becomes a glaring inconsistency for that which Achilles
anticipates as future, and even yet as contingent, <i>had actually
occurred</i> on the previous evening; the Greeks <i>had</i> supplicated at
his feet,—they <i>had proclaimed</i> their intolerable need,—and he had
spurned them. The Scholiast, in his explanation of these lines,
after giving the plain meaning, that “Achilles shows what he has
long been desiring, to see the Greeks in a state of supplication
to him,”—seems to recollect that this is in contradiction to the
ninth book, and tries to remove the contradiction, by saying “that
he had been previously mollified by conversation with Phœnix,”—ἤδη
δὲ προμαλαχθεὶς ἦν ἐκ τῶν Φοίνικος λόγων,—a supposition neither
countenanced by anything in the poet, nor sufficient to remove the
difficulty.</p>

<p>2. The speech of Poseidôn (xiii. 115) to encourage the dispirited
Grecian heroes, in which, after having admitted the injury done to
Achilles by Agamemnôn, he recommends an effort to heal the sore, and
intimates “that the minds of good men admit of this healing process,”
(Ἀλλ᾽ ἀκεώμεθα θᾶσσον· ἀκεσταί τε φρένες ἐσθλῶν,) is certainly not
very consistent with the supposition that this attempt to heal <i>had
been made</i> in the best possible way, and that Achilles had manifested
a mind implacable in the extreme on the evening before,—while the
mind of Agamemnôn was already brought to proclaimed humiliation, and
needed no farther healing.</p>

<p>3. And what shall we say to the language of Achilles and
Patroclus, at the beginning of the sixteenth book, just at the moment
when the danger has reached its maximum, and when Achilles is about
to send forth his friend?</p>

<p>Neither Nestor, when he invokes and instructs Patroclus as
intercessor with Achilles (xi. 654-790), nor Patroclus himself,
though in the extreme of anxiety to work upon the mind of Achilles,
and reproaching him with hardness of heart,—ever bring to remembrance
the ample atonement which had been tendered to him; while Achilles
himself repeats the original ground of quarrel, the wrong offered
to him in taking away Brisêis, continuing the language of the
first book; then, without the least allusion to the atonement and
restitution since tendered, he yields to his friend’s proposition,
just like a man whose wrong remained unredressed, but who was,
nevertheless, forced to take arms by necessity (xvi. 60-63):—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν προτετύχθαι ἐάσομεν, οὔδ᾽ ἄρα πως ἦν</p>
<p class="i0">Ἀσπερχὲς κεχολῶσθαι ἐνὶ φρεσίν· ἤτοι ἔφην γε</p>
<p class="i0">Οὐ πρὶν μηνιθμὸν καταπαύσεμεν, ἀλλ᾽ ὁπόταν δὴ</p>
<p class="i0">Νῆας ἐμὰς ἀφίκηται ἀϋτή τε πτόλεμός τε.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0 mt1">I agree with the Scholiast and Heyne in
interpreting ἔφην γε as equivalent to διενοήθην,—not as referring to
any express antecedent declaration.</p>

<p>Again, farther on in the same speech, “The Trojans (Achilles says)
now press boldly forward upon the ships, for they no longer see the
blaze of my helmet: but if Agamemnôn <i>were favorably disposed towards
me</i>, they would presently run away and fill the ditches with their
dead bodies” (71):—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">... τάχα κεν φεύγοντες ἐναύλους</p>
<p class="i0">Πλήσειαν νεκύων, εἴ μοι κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων</p>
<p class="i0">Ἤπια εἰδείη· νῦν δὲ στράτον ἀμφιμάχονται.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="ti0 mt1">Now here again, if we take our start from the
first book, omitting the ninth, the sentiment is perfectly just.
But assume the ninth book, and it becomes false and misplaced;
for Agamemnôn is then a prostrate and repentant man, not merely
“favorably disposed” towards Achilles, but offering to pay any price
for the purpose of appeasing him.</p>

<p>4. Again, a few lines farther, in the same speech, Achilles
permits Patroclus to go forth, in consideration of the extreme peril
of the fleet, but restricts him simply to avert this peril and do
nothing more: “Obey my words, so that you may procure <i>for me honor</i>
and glory from <i>the body of Greeks</i>, and that they may send back to
me the damsel, giving me ample presents besides: when you have driven
the Trojans from the ships, come back again”:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Ὡς ἄν μοι τιμὴν μεγάλην καὶ κῦδος ἄροιο</p>
<p class="i0">Πρὸς πάντων Δαναῶν· ἀτὰρ οἳ περικαλλέα κούρην</p>
<p class="i0">Ἄψ ἀπονάσσωσι, προτὶ δ᾽ ἀγλαὰ δῶρα πόρωσιν·</p>
<p class="i0">Ἐκ νηῶν ἐλάσας, ἰέναι πάλιν (84-87).</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1">How are we to reconcile this with the ninth book,
where Achilles declares that he does not care for being honored by
the Greeks, ix. 604? In the mouth of the affronted Achilles, of the
first book, such words are apt enough: he will grant succor, but
only to the extent necessary for the emergency, and in such a way
as to insure redress for his own wrong,—which redress he has no
reason as yet to conclude that Agamemnôn is willing to grant. But
the ninth book <i>has actually</i> tendered to him everything which he
here demands, and even more (the daughter of Agamemnôn in marriage,
without the price usually paid for a bride, etc.): Brisêis, whom now
he is so anxious to repossess, was then offered in restitution, and
he disdained the offer. Mr. Knight, in fact, strikes out these lines
as spurious; partly, because they contradict the ninth book, where
Achilles has actually rejected what he here thirsts for (“Dona cum
puellâ jam antea oblata aspernatus erat,”)—partly because he thinks
that they express a sentiment unworthy of Achilles; in which latter
criticism I do not concur.</p>

<p>5. We proceed a little farther to the address of Patroclus to
the Myrmidons, as he is conducting them forth to the battle: “Fight
bravely, Myrmidons, that we may bring honor to Achilles; and that the
wide-ruling Agamemnôn may know the mad folly which he committed, when
he dishonored the bravest of the Greeks.”</p>

<p>To impress this knowledge upon Agamemnôn was no longer necessary.
The ninth book records his humiliating confession of it, accompanied
by atonement and reparation. To teach him the lesson a second time,
is to break the bruised reed,—to slay the slain. But leave out the
ninth book, and the motive is the natural one,—both for Patroclus
to offer, and for the Myrmidons to obey: Achilles still remains a
dishonored man, and to humble the rival who has dishonored him is the
first of all objects, as well with his friends as with himself.</p>

<p>6. Lastly, the time comes when Achilles, in deep anguish for
the death of Patroclus, looks back with aversion and repentance to
the past. To what point should we expect that his repentance would
naturally turn? Not to his primary quarrel with Agamemnôn, in which
he had been undeniably wronged,—but to the scene in the ninth book,
where the maximum of atonement for the previous wrong is tendered to
him and scornfully rejected. Yet when we turn to xviii. 108, and xix.
55, 68, 270, we find him reverting to the primitive quarrel in the
first book, just as if it had been the last incident in his relations
with Agamemnôn: moreover, Agamemnôn (xix. 86), in <i>his</i> speech of
reconciliation, treats the past just in the same way,—deplores his
original insanity in wronging Achilles.</p>

<p>7. When we look to the prayers of Achilles and Thetis, addressed
to Zeus in the first book, we find that the consummation prayed for
is,—honor to Achilles,—redress for the wrong offered to him,—victory
to the Trojans until Agamemnôn and the Greeks shall be made bitterly
sensible of the wrong which they have done to their bravest warrior
(i. 409-509). Now this consummation is brought about in the ninth
book. Achilles can get no more, nor does he ultimately get more,
either in the way of redress to himself or remorseful humiliation
of Agamemnôn, than what is here tendered. The defeat which the
Greeks suffer in the battle of the eighth book (Κόλος Μάχη) has
brought about the consummation. The subsequent and much more
destructive defeats which they undergo are thus causeless: yet Zeus
is represented as inflicting them reluctantly, and only because they
are necessary to honor Achilles (xiii. 350; xv. 75, 235, 598; compare
also viii. 372 and 475).</p>

<p>If we reflect upon the constitution of the poem, we shall see
that the fundamental sequence of ideas in it is, a series of
misfortunes to the Greeks, brought on by Zeus for the special
purpose of procuring atonement to Achilles and bringing humiliation
on Agamemnôn: the introduction of Patroclus superadds new motives
of the utmost interest, but it is most harmoniously worked into the
fundamental sequence. Now the intrusion of the ninth book breaks
up the scheme of the poem by disuniting the sequence: Agamemnôn
is on his knees before Achilles, entreating pardon and proffering
reparation, yet the calamities of the Greeks become more and more
dreadful. The atonement of the ninth book comes at the wrong time and
in the wrong manner.</p>

<p>There are four passages (and only four, so far as I am aware) in
which the embassy of the ninth book is alluded to in the subsequent
books: one in xviii. 444-456, which was expunged as spurious by
Aristarchus (see the Scholia and Knight’s commentary, <i>ad loc.</i>);
and three others in the following book, wherein the gifts previously
tendered by Odysseus as the envoy of Agamemnôn are noticed as
identical with the gifts actually given in the nineteenth book. I
feel persuaded that these passages (vv. 140-141, 192-195, and 243)
are specially inserted for the purpose of establishing a connection
between the ninth book and the nineteenth. The four lines (192-195)
are decidedly better away: the first two lines (140-141) are noway
necessary; while the word χθιζὸς (which occurs in both passages) is
only rendered admissible by being stretched to mean <i>nudius tertius</i>
(Heyne, <i>ad loc.</i>).</p>

<p>I will only farther remark with respect to the ninth book, that
the speech of Agamemnôn (17-28), the theme for the rebuke of Diomêdês
and the obscure commonplace of Nestor, is taken verbatim from his
speech in the second book, in which place the proposition, of leaving
the place and flying, is made, not seriously, but as a stratagem (ii.
110, 118, 140).</p>

<p>The length of this note can only be excused by its direct bearing
upon the structure of the Iliad. To show that the books from the
eleventh downwards are composed by a poet who has no knowledge of the
ninth book, is, in my judgment, a very important point of evidence
in aiding us to understand what the original Achillêis was. The
books from the second to the seventh inclusive are insertions into
the Achillêis, and lie apart from its plot, but do not violently
contradict it, except in regard to the agora of the gods at the
beginning of the fourth book, and the almost mortal wound of Sarpêdon
in his battle with Tlepolemus. But the ninth book overthrows the
fundamental scheme of the poem.</p>

<p id="Footnote_290"><span class="label"><a

Heldenalters, p. 30) says, “The consciousness in the bosom of
Agamemnôn that he has offered atonement to Achilles strengthens his
confidence and valor,” &amp;c. This is the idea of the critic, not
of the poet. It does not occur in the Iliad, though the critic not
unnaturally imagines that it <i>must</i> occur. Agamemnôn never says, “I
was wrong in provoking Achilles, but you see I have done everything
which man could do to beg his pardon.” Assuming the ninth book to be
a part of the original conception, this feeling is so natural, that
we could hardly fail to find it, at the beginning of the eleventh
book, numbered among the motives of Agamemnôn.</p>

<p id="Footnote_293"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_293">[293]</a></span> O. Müller, (History of Greek
Literature, ch. v. § 8,) doubts whether the beginning of the
second book was written “by the ancient Homer, or by one of the
later Homerids:” he thinks the speech of Agamemnôn, wherein he
plays off the deceit upon his army, is “a copious parody (of the
same words used in the ninth book) composed by a later Homerid,
and inserted in the room of an originally shorter account of the
arming of the Greeks.” He treats the scene in the Grecian agora as
“an entire mythical comedy, full of fine irony and with an amusing
plot, in which the deceiving and deceived Agamemnôn is the chief
character.”</p>

<p>The comic or ironical character which is here ascribed to the
second book appears to me fanciful and incorrect; but Müller
evidently felt the awkwardness of the opening incident, though his
way of accounting for it is not successful. The second book seems to
my judgment just as serious as any part of the poem.</p>

<p>I think also that the words alluded to by O. Müller in the ninth
book are a transcript of those in the second, instead of the reverse,
as he believes,—because it seems probable that the ninth book is an
addition made to the poem after the books between the first and the
eighth had been already inserted,—it is certainly introduced after
the account of the fortification, contained in the seventh book, had
become a part of the poem: see ix. 349. The author of the Embassy
to Achilles fancied that that hero had been too long out of sight,
and out of mind,—a supposition for which there was no room in the
original Achillêis, when the eighth and eleventh books followed in
immediate succession to the first, but which offers itself naturally
to any one on reading our present Iliad.</p>

<p id="Footnote_295"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_295">[295]</a></span> Heyne treats the eighth book
as decidedly a separate song, or epic; a supposition which the
language of Zeus and the agora of the gods at the beginning are alone
sufficient to refute, in my judgment (Excursus 1, ad lib. xi. vol.
vi. p. 269). This Excursus, in describing the sequence of events in
the Iliad, passes at once and naturally from book eighth to book
eleventh.</p>

<p>And Mr. Payne Knight, when he defends book eleventh against Heyne,
says, “Quæ in undecimâ rhapsodiâ Iliadis narrata sunt, haud minus ex
ante narratis pendent: neque rationem pugnæ commissæ, neque rerum
in eâ gestarum nexum atque ordinem, quisquam intelligere posset,
nisi <i>iram et secessum</i> Achillis, et <i>victoriam</i> quam Trojani inde
consecuti erant, antea cognosset.” (Prolegom. c. xxix.)</p>

<p>Perfectly true: to understand the eleventh book, we must have
before us the first and the eighth (which are those that describe the
anger and withdrawal of Achilles, and the defeat which the Greeks
experience in consequence of it); we may dispense with the rest.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_296"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_296">[296]</a></span> O. Müller (Hist. Greek Literat.
ch. v. § 6) says, about this wall: “Nor is it until the Greeks are
<i>taught by the experience of the first day’s fighting</i>, that the
Trojans can resist them in open battle, that the Greeks build the
wall round their ships.... This appeared to Thucydidês so little
conformable to historical probability, that, without regard to the
authority of Homer, he placed the building of these walls immediately
after the landing.”</p>

<p>It is to be lamented, I think, that Thucydidês took upon him to
determine the point at all as a matter of history; but when he once
undertook this, the account in the Iliad was not of a nature to give
him much satisfaction, nor does the reason assigned by Müller make
it better. It is implied in Müller’s reason that, before the first
day’s battle, the Greeks did not believe that the Trojans <i>could</i>
resist them in open battle: the Trojans (according to him) never had
maintained the field, so long as Achilles was up and fighting on the
Grecian side, and therefore the Greeks were quite astonished to find
now, for the first time, that they <i>could</i> do so.</p>

<p>Now nothing can be more at variance with the tenor of the second
and following books than this supposition. The Trojans come forth
readily and fight gallantly; neither Agamemnôn, nor Nestor, nor
Odysseus consider them as enemies who cannot hold front; and the
circuit of exhortation by Agamemnôn (Epipôlêsis), so strikingly
described in the fourth book, proves that <i>he</i> does not anticipate
a very easy victory. Nor does Nestor, in proposing the construction
of the wall, give the smallest hint that the power of the Trojans
to resist in the open field was to the Greeks an unexpected
discovery.</p>

<p>The reason assigned by Müller, then, is a fancy of his own,
proceeding from the same source of mistake as others among his
remarks; because he tries to find, in the books between the first and
eighth, a governing reference to Achilles (the point of view of the
Achillêis), which those books distinctly refuse. The Achillêis was
a poem of Grecian disasters up to the time when Achilles sent forth
Patroclus; and during those disasters, it might suit the poet to
refer by contrast to the past time when Achilles was active, and to
say that <i>then</i> the Trojans did not dare even to present themselves
in battle-array in the field, whereas <i>now</i> they were assailing the
ships. But the author of books ii. to vii. has no wish to glorify
Achilles: he gives us a picture of the Trojan war generally, and
describes the Trojans, not only as brave and equal enemies, but well
known by the Greeks themselves to be so.</p>

<p>The building of the Grecian wall, as it now stands described, is
an unexplained proceeding, which Müller’s ingenuity does not render
consistent.</p>

original Iliad, enlarged by successive additions to the present
dimensions, and more or less interpolated (we must distinguish
<i>enlargement</i> from <i>interpolation</i>,—the insertion of a new rhapsody
from that of a new line), seems to be a sort of intermediate
compromise, towards which the opposing views of Wolf, J. H. Voss,
Nitzsch, Hermann, and Boeckh, all converge. Baumgarten-Crusius calls
this smaller poem an Achillêis.</p>

<p>Wolf, Preface to the Göschen edit. of the Iliad, pp. xii-xxiii;
Voss, Anti-Symbolik, part ii. p. 234; Nitzsch, Histor. Homeri,
Fasciculus i. p. 112; and Vorrede to the second volume of his
Comments on the Odyssey, p. xxvi: “In the Iliad (he there says)
many single portions may very easily be imagined as parts of
another whole, or as having been once separately sung.” (See
Baumgarten-Crusius, Preface to his edition of W. Müller’s Homerische
Vorschule, pp. xlv-xlix.)</p>

<p>Nitzsch distinguishes the Odyssey from the Iliad, and I think
justly, in respect to this supposed enlargement. The reasons which
warrant us in applying this theory to the Iliad have no bearing upon
the Odyssey. If there ever was an Ur-Odyssee, we have no means of
determining what it contained.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_300"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_300">[300]</a></span> The remarks of O. Müller on
the Iliad (in his History of Greek Literature) are highly deserving
of perusal: with much of them I agree, but there is also much which
seems to me unfounded. The range of combination, and the far-fetched
narrative stratagem which he ascribes to the primitive author, are in
my view inadmissible (chap. v. § 5-11):—</p>

<p>“The internal connection of the Iliad (he observes, § 6) rests
upon the union of certain parts; and neither the interesting
introduction, describing the defeat of the Greeks up to the burning
of the ship of Protesilaus, nor the turn of affairs brought about by
the death of Patroclus, nor the final pacification of the anger of
Achilles, could be spared from the Iliad, when the fruitful seed of
such a poem had once been sown in the soul of Homer, and had begun to
develop its growth. But the plan of the Iliad is certainly very much
extended beyond what was actually necessary; and in particular, the
preparatory part, consisting of the <i>attempts</i> on the part of <i>the
other heroes to compensate for the absence of Achilles</i>, has, it must
be owned, been drawn out to a disproportionate length, so that the
suspicion that there were later insertions of importance applies with
greater probability to the first than to the last books.... A design
manifested itself at an early period to make this poem complete in
itself, so that all the subjects, descriptions, and actions, which
could alone give interest to a poem <i>on the entire war</i>, might find a
place within the limits of its composition. For this purpose, it is
not improbable that many lays of earlier bards, who had sung single
adventures of the Trojan war, were laid under contribution, and the
finest parts of them incorporated in the new poem.”</p>

<p>These remarks of O. Müller intimate what is (in my judgment) the
right view, inasmuch as they recognize an extension of the plan of
the poem beyond its original limit, manifested by insertions in
the first half; and it is to be observed that, in his enumeration
of those parts, the union of which is necessary to the internal
connection of the Iliad, nothing is mentioned except what is
comprised in books i. viii. xi. to xxii. or xxiv. But his description
of “<i>the preparatory part</i>,” as “<i>the attempts of the other heroes
to compensate for the absence of Achilles</i>,” is noway borne out by
the poet himself. From the second to the seventh book, Achilles is
scarcely alluded to; moreover, the Greeks do perfectly well without
him. This portion of the poem displays, not “the <i>insufficiency</i> of
all the other heroes without Achilles,” as Müller had observed in the
preceding section, but the perfect <i>sufficiency</i> of the Greeks under
Diomêdês, Agamemnôn, etc. to make head against Troy; it is only in
the eighth book that their <i>insufficiency</i> begins to be manifested,
and only in the eleventh book that it is consummated by the wounds
of the three great heroes. Diomêdês is, in fact, exalted to a pitch
of glory in regard to contests with the gods, which even Achilles
himself never obtains afterwards, and Helenus the Trojan puts him
above Achilles (vi. 99) in terrific prowess. Achilles is mentioned
two or three times as absent, and Agamemnôn, in his speech to the
Grecian agora, regrets the quarrel (ii. 377), but we never hear any
such exhortation as, “Let us do our best to make up for the absence
of Achilles,”—not even in the Epipôlêsis of Agamemnôn, where it would
most naturally be found. “Attempts to compensate for the absence of
Achilles” must, therefore, be treated as the idea of the critic, not
of the poet.</p>

<p>Though O. Müller has glanced at the distinction between the two
parts of the poem (an original part, having chief reference to
<i>Achilles and the Greeks</i>; and a superinduced part, having reference
to <i>the entire war</i>), he has not conceived it clearly, nor carried it
out consistently. If we are to distinguish these two points of view
at all, we ought to draw the lines at the end of the first book and
at the beginning of the eighth, thus regarding the intermediate six
books as belonging to the picture of <i>the entire war</i> (or the Iliad as
distinguished from the Achillêis): the point of view of the Achillêis,
dropped at the end of the first book, is resumed at the beginning of
the eighth. The natural fitting together of these two parts is noticed
in the comment of Heyne, ad viii. 1: “Cæterum <i>nunc</i> Jupiter aperte
solvit Thetidi promissa, dum reddit causam Trojanorum bello superiorem,
ut Achillis desiderium Achivos, et pœnitentia injuriæ ei illatæ
Agamemnonem incessat (cf. i. 5). Nam quæ <i>adhuc</i> narrata sunt, partim
continebantur in fortunâ belli utrinque tentatâ ... partim valebant
ad narrationem variandam,” etc. The first and the eighth books belong
to one and the same point of view, while <i>all</i> the intermediate books
belong to the other. But O. Müller seeks to prove that a portion of
these intermediate books belongs to one common point of view with the
first and eighth, though he admits that they have been enlarged by
insertions. Here I think he is mistaken. Strike out anything which can
be reasonably allowed for enlargement in the books between the first
and eighth, and the same difficulty will still remain in respect to
the remainder; for <i>all</i> the incidents between those two points are
brought out in a spirit altogether indifferent to Achilles or his
anger. The Zeus of the fourth book, as contrasted with Zeus in the
first or eighth, marks the difference; and this description of Zeus is
absolutely indispensable as the connecting link between book iii. on
the one side and books iv. and v. on the other. Moreover, the attempt
of O. Müller, to force upon the larger portion of what is between the
first and eighth books the point of view of the Achillêis, is never
successful: the poet does not exhibit in those books “insufficient
efforts of other heroes to compensate for the absence of Achilles,”
but a general and highly interesting picture of the Trojan war, with
prominent reference to the original ground of quarrel. In this picture,
the duel between Paris and Menelaus forms naturally the foremost
item,—but how far-fetched is the reasoning whereby O. Müller brings
that striking recital within the scheme of the Achillêis! “The Greeks
and Trojans are for the first time struck by an idea, which might have
occurred in the previous nine years, if the Greeks, <i>when assisted
by Achilles</i>, had not, from <i>confidence in their superior strength</i>,
considered every compromise as unworthy of them,—namely, to decide the
war by a single combat between the authors of it.” Here the causality
of Achilles is dragged in by main force, and unsupported either by
any actual statement in the poem or by any reasonable presumption;
for it is <i>the Trojans</i> who propose the single combat, and we are not
told that they had ever proposed it before, though they would have had
stronger reasons for proposing it during the presence of Achilles than
during his absence.</p>

<p>O. Müller himself remarks (§ 7), “that from the second to the
seventh book Zeus appears as it were to have forgotten his resolution
and his promise to Thetis.” In other words, the poet, during this
part of the poem, drops the point of view of the Achillêis to take up
that of the more comprehensive Iliad: the Achillêis reappears in book
viii,—again disappears in book x,—and is resumed from book xi. to the
end of the poem.</p>

noticed by M. Fauriel, in reference to the <i>Romans</i> of the Middle
Ages:—</p>

<p>“C’est un phénomène remarquable dans l’histoire de la poésie
épique, que cette disposition, cette tendance constante du goût
populaire à amalgamer, à lier en une seule et même composition le
plus possible des compositions diverses,—cette disposition persiste
chez un peuple, tant que la poésie conserve un reste de vie; tant
qu’elle s’y transmet par la tradition et qu’elle y circule à l’aide
du chant ou des récitations publiques. Elle cesse partout où la
poésie est une fois fixée dans les livres, et n’agit plus que par
la lecture,—cette dernière époque est pour ainsi dire, celle de la
propriété poétique—celle où chaque poëte prétend à une existence, à
une gloire, personnelles; et où la poésie cesse d’être une espèce
de trésor commun dont le peuple jouit et dispose à sa manière, sans
s’inquiéter des individus qui le lui ont fait.” (Fauriel, Sur les
Romans Chevaleresques, leçon 5<sup>me</sup>, Revue des Deux Mondes,
vol. xiii. p. 707.)</p>

the agora of the gods,—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Ἀμφοτέροισι δ᾽ ἀρήγετ᾽, ὅπη νόος ἐστὶν ἑκάστου·</p>
<p class="i0">Εἰ γὰρ Ἀχιλλεὺς οἶος ἐπὶ Τρώεσσι μαχεῖται,</p>

</div></div>

<p class="mt1">The formal restriction put upon the gods by Zeus at
the beginning of the eighth book, and the removal of that restriction
at the beginning of the twentieth, are evidently parts of one
preconceived scheme.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine whether the battle of the gods and
goddesses in book xxi. (385-520) is to be expunged as spurious, or
only to be blamed as of inferior merit (“improbanda tantum, non
resecanda—hoc enim est illud, quo plerumque summa criseôs Homericæ
redit,” as Heyne observes in another place, Obss. Iliad. xviii.
444). The objections on the score of non-Homeric locution are not
forcible (see P. Knight, <i>ad loc.</i>), and the scene belongs to that
vein of conception which animates the poet in the closing act of his
Achillêis.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_306"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_306">[306]</a></span> While admitting that these last
books of the Iliad are not equal in interest with those between the
eleventh and eighteenth, we may add that they exhibit many striking
beauties, both of plan and execution, and one in particular may be
noticed as an example of happy epical adaptation. The Trojans are on
the point of ravishing from the Greeks the dead body of Patroclus,
when Achilles (by the inspiration of Hêrê and Iris) shows himself
unarmed on the Grecian mound, and by his mere figure and voice
strikes such terror into the Trojans that they relinquish the dead
body. As soon as night arrives, Polydamas proposes, in the Trojan
agora, that the Trojans shall retire without farther delay from the
ships to the town, and shelter themselves within the walls, without
awaiting the assault of Achilles armed on the next morning. Hector
repels this counsel of Polydamas with expressions,—not merely of
overweening confidence in his own force, even against Achilles,—but
also of extreme contempt and harshness towards the giver; whose
wisdom, however, is proved by the utter discomfiture of the Trojans
the next day. Now this angry deportment and mistake on the part of
Hector is made to tell strikingly in the twenty-second book, just
before his death. There yet remains a moment for him to retire within
the walls, and thus obtain shelter against the near approach of his
irresistible enemy, but he is struck with the recollection of that
fatal moment when he repelled the counsel which would have saved
his countrymen: “If I enter the town, Polydamas will be the first
to reproach me, as having brought destruction upon Troy on that
fatal night when Achilles came forth, and when I resisted his better
counsel.” (Compare xviii. 250-315; xxii. 100-110; and Aristot. Ethic.
iii. 8.)</p>

<p>In a discussion respecting the structure of the Iliad, and
in reference to arguments which deny all designed concatenation
of parts, it is not out of place to notice this affecting touch
of poetry, belonging to those books which are reproached as the
feeblest.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_307"><span class="label"><a

seventh book is spoiled by the very unsatisfactory addition
introduced to explain the construction of the wall and ditch: all the
other incidents (the agora and embassy of the Trojans, the truce for
burial, the arrival of wine-ships from Lemnos, etc.) suit perfectly
with the scheme of the poet of these books, to depict the Trojan war
generally.</p>

<p id="Footnote_310"><span class="label"><a

thinking that the naked story, (of Diomêdês slaughtering Rhêsus and
his companions in their sleep,) as it now stands in the Iliad, was
too displeasing, adopted different ways of dressing it up. Thus,
according to Pindar (ap. Schol. Iliad. x. 435), Rhêsus fought one
day as the ally of Troy, and did such terrific damage, that the
Greeks had no other means of averting total destruction from his hand
on the next day, except by killing him during the night. And the
Euripidean drama, called <i>Rhêsus</i>, though representing the latter as
a new-comer, yet puts into the mouth of Athênê the like overwhelming
predictions of what he would do on the coming day, if suffered to
live; so that to kill him in the night is the only way of saving
the Greeks (Eurip. Rhês. 602): moreover, Rhêsus himself is there
brought forward as talking with such overweening insolence, that the
sympathies of man, and the envy of the gods, are turned against him
(<i>ib.</i> 458).</p>

<p>But the story is best known in the form and with the addition
(equally unknown to the Iliad) which Virgil has adopted. It was
decreed by fate that, if the splendid horses of Rhêsus were permitted
once either to taste the Trojan provender, or to drink of the river
Xanthus, nothing could preserve the Greeks from ruin (Æneid, i. 468,
with Servius, <i>ad loc.</i>):—</p>

(p. 306) to his work Ueber das Zeitalter und Vaterland des Homer.</p>

<p>He shows all such arguments to be very inconclusive; though the
grounds upon which he himself maintains identity of age between the
two appear to me not at all more satisfactory (p. 327): we can infer
nothing to the point from the mention of Telemachus in the Iliad.</p>

<p>Welcker thinks that there is a great difference of age, and an
evident difference of authorship, between the two poems (Der Episch.

<p id="Footnote_315"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_315">[315]</a></span> Dr. Thirlwall has added to
the second edition of his History of Greece a valuable Appendix,
on the early history of the Homeric poems (vol. i. pp. 500-516);
which contains copious information respecting the discrepant
opinions of German critics, with a brief comparative examination of
their reasons. I could have wished that so excellent a judge had
superadded, to his enumeration of the views of others, an ampler
exposition of his own. Dr. Thirlwall seems decidedly convinced upon
that which appears to me the most important point in the Homeric
controversy: “That before the appearance of the earliest of the poems
of the Epic Cycle, the Iliad and Odyssey, even if they did not exist
precisely in their present form, had at least reached their present
compass, and were regarded each as a complete and well-defined whole,
not as a fluctuating aggregate of fugitive pieces.” (p. 509.)</p>

<p>This marks out the Homeric poems as ancient both in the items
and in the total, and includes negation of the theory of Wolf
and Lachmann, who contend that, as a total, they only date from
the age of Peisistratus. It is then safe to treat the poems as
unquestionable evidences of Grecian antiquity (meaning thereby 776
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), which we could not do if we regarded all
congruity of parts in the poems as brought about through alterations
of Peisistratus and his friends.</p>

<p>There is also a very just admonition of Dr. Thirlwall (p. 516)
as to the difficulty of measuring what degree of discrepancy or
inaccuracy might or might not have escaped the poet’s attention, in
an age so imperfectly known to us.</p>

were extolled by Aristotle; see Schol. ad Iliad. i. 481; compare
Dionys. Halicarn. De Compos. Verbor. c. 20. ὥστε μηδὲν ἡμῖν διαφέρειν
γινόμενα τὰ πράγματα ἢ λεγόμενα ὁρᾶν. Respecting the undisguised
bursts of feeling by the heroes, the Scholiast ad Iliad, i. 349 tells
us,—ἕτοιμον τὸ ἡπωϊκον πρὸς δάκρυα,—compare Euripid. Helen. 959, and
the severe censures of Plato, Republ. ii. p. 388.</p>

<p>The Homeric poems were the best understood, and the most widely
popular of all Grecian composition, even among the least instructed
persons, such (for example) as the semibarbarians who had acquired
the Greek language in addition to their own mother tongue. (Dio
Chrysost. Or. xviii. vol. i. p. 478; Or. liii. vol. ii. p. 277,
Reisk.) Respecting the simplicity and perspicuity of the narrative
style, implied in this extensive popularity, Porphyry made a
singular remark: he said, that the sentences of Homer <i>really</i>
presented much difficulty and obscurity, but that ordinary readers
fancied they understood him, “because of the general clearness
<i>which appeared</i> to run through the poems.” (See the Prolegomena of
Villoison’s edition of the Iliad, p. xli.) This remark affords the
key to a good deal of the Homeric criticism. There doubtless were
real obscurities in the poems, arising from altered associations,
customs, religion, language, etc., as well as from corrupt text; but
while the critics did good service in elucidating these difficulties,
they also introduced artificially many others, altogether of their
own creating. Refusing to be satisfied with the plain and obvious
meaning, they sought in Homer hidden purposes, elaborate innuendo,
recondite motives even with regard to petty details, deep-laid
rhetorical artifices (see a specimen in Dionys. Hal. Ars Rhetor.
c. 15, p. 316, Reiske; nor is even Aristotle exempt from similar
tendencies, Schol. ad Iliad. iii. 441, x. 198), or a substratum of
philosophy allegorized. No wonder that passages, quite perspicuous to
the vulgar reader, seemed difficult to them.</p>

<p>There could not be so sure a way of missing the real Homer as by
searching for him in these devious recesses. He is essentially the
poet of the broad highway and the market-place, touching the common
sympathies and satisfying the mental appetencies of his countrymen
with unrivalled effect; but exempt from ulterior views, either
selfish or didactic, and immersed in the same medium of practical
life and experience, religiously construed, as his auditors. No
nation has ever yet had so perfect and touching an exposition of its
early social mind as the Iliad and Odyssey exhibit.</p>

<p>In the verbal criticism of Homer, the Alexandrine literati seem to
have made a very great advance, as compared with the glossographers
who preceded them. (See Lehrs, De Studiis Aristarchi, Dissert. ii. p.
42.)</p>

<p class="ti0 mt1">Horace contrasts the folly and greediness of the
companions of Ulysses, in accepting the refreshments tendered to
them by Circe, with the self-command of Ulysses himself in refusing
them. But in the incident as described in the original poem, neither
the praise nor the blame, here implied, finds any countenance. The
companions of Ulysses follow the universal practice in accepting
hospitality tendered to strangers, the fatal consequences of
which, in their particular case, they could have no ground for
suspecting; while Ulysses is preserved from a similar fate, not by
any self-command of his own, but by a previous divine warning and
a special antidote, which had not been vouchsafed to the rest (see
Odyss. x. 285). And the incident of the Sirens, if it is to be taken
as evidence of anything, indicates rather the absence, than the
presence, of self-command on the part of Ulysses.</p>

<p>Of the violent mutations of text, whereby the <i>Grammatici</i> or
critics tried to efface from Homer bad ethical tendencies (we
must remember that many of these men were lecturers to youth), a
remarkable specimen is afforded by Venet. Schol. ad Iliad. ix. 453;
compare Plutarch, de Audiendis Poetis, p. 95. Phœnix describes
the calamitous family tragedy in which he himself had been partly
the agent, partly the victim. Now that an Homeric hero should
confess guilty proceedings, and still more guilty designs, without
any expression of shame or contrition, was insupportable to the
feelings of the critics. One of them, Aristodemus, thrust two
negative particles into one of the lines; and though he thereby
ruined not only the sense but the metre, his emendation procured
for him universal applause, because he had maintained the innocence
of the hero (καὶ οὐ μόνον ηὐδοκίμησεν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐτιμήθη, ὡς εὐσεβῆ
τηρήσας τὸν ἥρωα). And Aristarchus thought the case so alarming,
that he struck out from the text four lines, which have only been
preserved to us by Plutarch (Ὁ μὲν Ἀρίσταρχος ἔξειλε τὰ ἔπη ταῦτα,
<em class="gesperrt">φοβηθείς</em>). See the Fragment of Dioscorides

in Morea, vol. iii. pp. 45, 153-155), “The plain of Tripolitza
(anciently that of Tegea and Mantineia) is by far the greatest of
that cluster of valleys in the centre of Peloponnesus, each of which
is so closely shut in by the intersecting mountains, that no outlet
is afforded to the waters except through the mountains themselves,”
etc. Respecting the Arcadian Orchomenus, and its inclosed lake with
Katabothra, see the same work, p. 103; and the mountain plains near
Corinth, p. 263.</p>

<p>This temporary disappearance of the rivers was familiar to the
ancient observers—οἱ καταπινόμενοι τῶν ποταμῶν. (Aristot. Meteorolog.
i. 13. Diodor. xv. 49. Strabo, vi. p. 271; viii. p. 389, etc.)</p>

<p>Their familiarity with this phenomenon was in part the source of
some geographical suppositions, which now appear to us extravagant,
respecting the long subterranean and submarine course of certain
rivers, and their reappearance at very distant points. Sophokles
said that the Inachus of Akarnania joined the Inachus of Argolis:
Ibykus the poet affirmed that the Asôpus, near Sikyon, had its
source in Phrygia; the river Inôpus of the little island of Delos
was alleged by others to be an effluent from the mighty Nile; and
the rhetor Zôilus, in a panegyrical oration to the inhabitants of
Tenedos, went the length of assuring them that the Alpheius in Elis
had its source in their island (Strabo, vi. p. 271). Not only Pindar
and other poets (Antigon. Caryst. c. 155), but also the historian
Timæus (Timæi Frag. 127, ed. Göller), and Pausanias, also, with the
greatest confidence (v. 7, 2), believed that the fountain Arethusa,
at Syracuse, was nothing else but the reappearance of the river
Alpheius from Peloponnesus: this was attested by the actual fact that
a goblet or cup (φιάλη), thrown into the Alpheius, had come up at the
Syracusan fountain, which Timæus professed to have verified,—but even
the arguments by which Strabo justifies his disbelief of this tale,
show how powerfully the phenomena of the Grecian rivers acted upon
his mind. “If (says he, <i>l. c.</i>) the Alpheius, instead of flowing
into the sea, fell into some chasm in the earth, there would be some
plausibility in supposing that it continued its subterranean course
as far as Sicily without mixing with the sea: but since its junction
with the sea is matter of observation, and since there is no aperture
visible near the shore to absorb the water of the river (στόμα τὸ
καταπῖνον τὸ ῥεῦμα τοῦ ποταμοῦ), so it is plain that the water
cannot maintain its separation and its sweetness, whereas the spring
Arethusa is perfectly good to drink.” I have translated here the
sense rather than the words of Strabo; but the phenomena of “rivers
falling into chasms and being drunk up,” for a time, is exactly what
happens in Greece. It did not appear to Strabo impossible that the
Alpheius might traverse this great distance underground; nor do we
wonder at this, when we learn that a more able geographer than he
(Eratosthenês) supposed that the marshes of Rhinokolura, between
the Mediterranean and the Red sea, were formed by the Euphrates and
Tigris, which flowed underground for the length of 6000 stadia or
furlongs (Strabo, xvi. p. 741: Seidel; Fragm. Eratosth. p. 194):
compare the story about the Euphrates passing underground, and
reappearing in Ethiopia as the river Nile (Pausan. ii. 5, 3). This
disappearance and reappearance of rivers connected itself, in the
minds of ancient physical philosophers, with the supposition of
vast reservoirs of water in the interior of the earth, which were
protruded upwards to the surface by some gaseous force (see Seneca,
Nat. Quæst. vi. 8). Pomponius Mela mentions an idea of some writers,
that the source of the Nile was to be found, not in our (οἰκουμένη)
habitable section of the globe, but in the Antichthon, or southern
continent, and that it flowed under the ocean to rise up in Ethiopia
(Mela, i. 9, 55).</p>

<p>These views of the ancients, evidently based upon the analogy of
Grecian rivers, are well set forth by M. Letronne, in a paper on
the situation of the Terrestrial Paradise, as represented by the
Fathers of the Church; cited in A. von Humboldt, Examen Critique de
l’Histoire de la Géographie, etc., vol. iii. pp. 118-130.</p>

and regency in 1833 (observes Mr. Strong), no carriage-roads existed
in Greece; nor were they, indeed, much wanted previously, as down to
that period not a carriage, waggon, or cart, or any other description
of vehicles, was to be found in the whole country. The traffic in
general was carried on by means of boats, to which the long indented
line of the Grecian coast and its numerous islands afforded every
facility. Between the seaports and the interior of the kingdom, the
communication was effected by means of beasts of burden, such as
mules, horses, and camels.” (Statistics of Greece, p. 33.)</p>

<p>This exhibits a retrograde march to a point lower than the
description of the Odyssey, where Telemachus and Peisistratus drive
their chariot from Pylus to Sparta. The remains of the ancient roads

deserves to be noticed, though his warm eulogies on the fertility
of the soil, taken generally, are not borne out by later observers:
“The physical phenomena of Greece, differing from those of any
other country, present a series of beautiful plains, successively
surrounded by mountains of limestone; resembling, although upon
a larger scale, and rarely accompanied by volcanic products, the
craters of the Phlegræan fields. Everywhere, their level surfaces
seems to have been deposited by water, gradually retired or
evaporated; they consist for the most part of the richest soil, and
their produce is yet proverbially abundant. In this manner, stood the
cities of Argos, Sikyon, Corinth, Megara, Eleusis, Athens, Thebes,
Amphissa, Orchomenus, Chæronea, Lebadea, Larissa, Pella, and many
others.” (Dr. Clarke’s Travels, vol. ii. ch. 4, p. 74.)</p>

near Tegea, though not more than twenty-four miles from Argos....
Cattle are sent from thence every winter to the maritime plains of
Elos in Laconia (Leake, Trav. in Morea, vol. i. pp. 88, 98, 197). The
pasture on Mount Olono (boundary of Elis, Arcadia, and Achaia) is

though his remarks have a more exact bearing upon Greece than upon
any other country. And we may copy a passage out of Tacitus (Agricol.
c. 10), written in reference to Britain, which applies far more
precisely to Greece: “nusquam latius dominari mare ... nec litore

2-4, in the Fragments of that lost treatise, ed. Maii) notices
emphatically both the general maritime accessibility of Grecian
towns, and the effects of that circumstance on Grecian character:
“Quod de Corintho dixi, id haud scio an liceat de cunctâ Græciâ
verissime dicere. Nam et ipsa Peloponnesus fere tota in mari est:
nec prætor Phliuntios ulli sunt, quorum agri non contingant mare: et
extra Peloponnesum Ænianes et Dores et Dolopes soli absunt a mari.
Quid dicam insulas Græciæ, quæ fluctibus cinctæ natant pæne ipsæ
simul cum civitatium institutis et moribus? Atque hæc quidem, ut
supra dixi, veteris sunt Græciæ. Coloniarum vero quæ est deducta a
Graiis in Asiam, Thraciam, Italiam, Siciliam, Africam, præter unam
Magnesiam, quam unda non alluat? Ita barbarorum agris quasi adtexta
quædam videtur ora esse Græciæ.”</p>

<p>Compare Cicero, Epistol. ad Attic. vi. 2, with the reference
to Dikæarchus, who agreed to a great extent in Plato’s objections
against a maritime site (De Legg. iv. p. 705; also, Aristot. Politic.
vii. 5-6). The sea (says Plato) is indeed a salt and bitter neighbor
(μάλα γε μὴν ὄντως ἁλμυρὸν καὶ πικρὸν γειτόνημα), though convenient

“Se, ut consceleratos contaminatosque, ab <i>ludis, festis diebus, cœtu

piorum, cœtu, concilioque abigi.” It is curious to contrast this

<p id="Footnote_377"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_377">[377]</a></span> Plutarch, Solôn, 23. The
Isthmian Agon was to a certain extent a festival of old Athenian
origin; for among the many legends respecting its first institution,
one of the most notorious represented it as having been founded by
Theseus after his victory over Sinis at the Isthmus (see Schol.
ad Pindar. Isth. Argument.; Pausan. ii. 1, 4), or over Skeirôn
(Plutarch, Theseus, c. 25). Plutarch says that they were first
established by Theseus as funeral games for Skeirôn, and Pliny gives
the same story (H. N. vii. 57). According to Hellanikus, the Athenian
Theôrs at the Isthmian games had a privileged place, (Plutarch, <i>l.
c.</i>).</p>

<p>There is, therefore, good reason why Solôn should single out the
Isthmionikæ as persons to be specially rewarded, not mentioning the
Pythionikæ and Nemeonikæ,—the Nemean and Pythian games not having
then acquired Hellenic importance. Diogenes Laërt. (i. 55) says that
Solôn provided rewards, not only for victories at the Olympic and
Isthmian, but also ἀνάλογον ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων, which Krause (Pythien,
Nemeen und Isthmien, sect. 3, p. 13) supposes to be the truth: I
think, very improbably. The sharp invective of Timokreon against
Themistocles, charging him among other things with providing nothing
but cold meat at the Isthmian games (Ἰσθμοῖ δ᾽ ἐπανδόκευε γελοίως
ψυχρὰ κρέα παρέχων, Plutarch. Themistoc. c. 21), seems to imply that
the Athenian visitors, whom the Theôrs were called upon to take care
of at those games, were numerous.</p>

chosen for the special occasion (see Thucyd. v. 47; Aristotel. Polit.

Thessalians, and Achæans of Phthiôtis, was celebrated a periodical
religious festival, or panegyris, the title of which we are prevented
from making out by the imperfection of Strabo’s text (Strabo, ix.
436). It stands in the text as printed in Tzschucke’s edition,
Ἐνταῦθα δὲ καὶ τὴν Πυλαϊκὴν πανήγυριν, συνετέλουν. The mention
of Πυλαϊκὴ πανήγυρις, which conducts us only to the Amphiktyonic
convocations of Thermopylæ and Delphi is here unsuitable; and the
best or Parisian MS. of Strabo presents a gap (one among the many
which embarrass the ninth book) in the place of the word Πυλαϊκὴν.
Dutneil conjectures τὴν Πελϊακὴν πανήγυριν, deriving the name from
the celebrated funeral games of the old epic celebrated by Akastus in
honor of his father Pelias. Grosskurd (in his note on the passage)
approves the conjecture, but it seems to me not probable that a
Grecian panegyris would be named after Pelias. Πηλϊακήν, in reference
to the neighboring mountain and town of Pelion, might perhaps be less
objectionable (see Dikæarch. Fragm. pp. 407-409, ed. Fuhr.), but we
cannot determine with certainty.</p>

<p id="Footnote_402"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_402">[402]</a></span> In this early phase of the
Pythian festival, it is said to have been celebrated every eight
years, marking what we should call an Octaetêris, and what the
early Greeks called an Ennaetêris (Censorinus, De Die Natali, c.
18). This period is one of considerable importance in reference to
the principle of the Grecian calendar, for ninety-nine lunar months
coincide very nearly with eight solar years. The discovery of this
coincidence is ascribed by Censorinus to Kleostratus of Tenedos,
whose age is not directly known: he must be anterior to Meton, who
discovered the cycle of nineteen solar years, but (I imagine) not
much anterior. In spite of the authority of Ideler, it seems to
me not proved, nor can I believe, that this octennial period with
its solar and lunar coincidence was known to the Greeks in the
earliest times of their mythical antiquity, or before the year 600
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> See Ideler, Handbuch der Chronologie,
vol. i. p. 366; vol. ii. p. 607. The practice of the Eleians to
celebrate the Olympic games alternately after forty-nine and fifty
lunar months, though attested for a later time by the Scholiast on
Pindar, is not proved to be old. The fact that there were ancient
octennial recurring festivals, does not establish a knowledge of
the properties of the octaeteric or ennaeteric period: nor does it
seem to me that the details of the Bœotian δαφνηφορíα, described in
Proclus ap. Photium, sect. 239, are very ancient. See, on the old
mythical Octaetêris, O. Müller, Orchomenos 218, <i>seqq.</i>, and Krause,

<p id="Footnote_403"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_403">[403]</a></span> See the argument of Cicero in
favor of divination, in the first book of his valuable treatise De
Divinatione. Chrysippus, and the ablest of the stoic philosophers,
both set forth a plausible theory demonstrating, <i>a priori</i>, the
probability of prophetic warnings deduced from the existence and
attributes of the gods: if you deny altogether the occurrence of
such warnings, so essential to the welfare of man, you must deny
either the existence, or the foreknowledge, or the beneficence,
of the gods (c. 38). Then the veracity of the Delphian oracle had
been demonstrated in innumerable instances, of which Chrysippus
had made a large collection: and upon what other supposition could
the immense credit of the oracle be explained (c. 19)? “Collegit
innumerabilia oracula Chrysippus, et nullum sine locuplete teste
et auctore: quæ quia nota tibi sunt, relinquo. Defendo unum hoc:
nunquam illud oraculum Delphis tam celebre clarumque fuisset,
neque tantis donis refertum omnium populorum et regum, nisi omnis
ætas oraculorum illorum veritatem esset experta.... Maneat id,
quod negari non potest, nisi omnem historiam perverterimus, multis
sæculis verax fuisse id oraculum.” Cicero admits that it had become
less trustworthy in his time, and tries to explain this decline of
prophetic power: compare Plutarch, De Defect. Oracul.</p>

hands, feet, or eyesight, in the satrapy of Cyrus the younger, who
had inflicted all these severe punishments for the prevention of
crime,—he did not (says Xenophon) suffer criminals to scoff at him
(εἴα καταγελᾷν). The ἐκτομὴ was carried on at Sardis (Herodot. iii.
49),—500 παῖδες ἐκτόμιαι formed a portion of the yearly tribute paid
by the Babylonians to the court of Susa (Herod. iii. 92). Selling
of children for exportation by the Thracians (Herod. v. 6); there
is some trace of this at Athens, prior to the Solonian legislation

the law between debtor and creditor. For the sacrifice of children

<p>Niebuhr puts together all the mythical and genealogical traces,

full historical conviction,” p. 54) “that there was a time when the
Pelasgians, perhaps the most extended people in all Europe, were
spread from the Po and the Arno to the Rhyndakus,” (near Kyzikus,)
with only an interruption in Thrace. What is perhaps the most
remarkable of all, is the contrast between his feeling of disgust,
despair, and aversion to the subject, when he begins the inquiry
(“<i>the name Pelasgi</i>,” he says, “<i>is odious to the historian, who
hates the spurious philology out of which the pretences to knowledge
on the subject of such extinct people arise</i>,” p. 28), and the full

<p>In the next chapter, Herodotus again calls the Pelasgian nation
βάρβαρον.</p>

<p>Respecting this language, heard by Herodotus at Krêstôn and
Plakia, Dr. Thirlwall observes (chap. ii. p. 60), “This language
Herodotus describes as barbarous, and it is on this fact he grounds
his general conclusion as to the ancient Pelasgian tongue. But he
has not entered into any details that might have served to ascertain
the manner or degree in which it differed from the Greek. Still,
the expressions he uses would have appeared to imply that it was
essentially foreign, had he not spoken quite as strongly in another
passage, where it is impossible to ascribe a similar meaning to his
words. When he is enumerating the dialects that prevailed among the
Ionian Greeks, he observes that the Ionian cities in Lydia agree not
at all in their tongue with those of Karia; and he applies the very
same term to these dialects, which he had before used in speaking
of the remains of the Pelasgian language. This passage affords a
measure by which we may estimate the force of the word <i>barbarian</i> in
the former. Nothing more can be safely inferred from it, than that
the Pelasgian language which Herodotus heard on the Hellespont, and
elsewhere, sounded to him a strange jargon: as did the dialect of
Ephesus to a Milesian, and as the Bolognese does to a Florentine.
This fact leaves its real nature and relation to the Greek quite
uncertain; and we are the less justified in building on it, as the
history of Pelasgian settlements is extremely obscure, and the
traditions which Herodotus reports on that subject have by no means
equal weight with statements made from his personal observation.”
(Thirlwall, History of Greece, ch. ii. p. 60, 2d edit.)</p>

<p>In the statement delivered by Herodotus (to which Dr. Thirlwall
here refers) about the language spoken in the Ionic Greek cities,
the historian had said (i. 142),—Γλῶσσαν δὲ οὐ τὴν αὐτὴν οὗτοι
νενομίκασι, ἀλλὰ τρόπους τέσσερας παραγωγέων. Miletus, Myus, and
Priêne,—ἐν τῇ Καρίῃ κατοίκηνται κατὰ ταὐτὰ διαλεγόμεναί σφι.
Ephesus, Kolophon, etc.,—αὐται αἱ πόλιες τῇσι πρότερον λεχθείσῃσι
ὁμολογέουσι κατὰ γλῶσσαν οὐδὲν, σφὶ δὲ ὁμοφωνέουσι. The Chians and
Erythræans,—κατὰ τὠϋτὸ διαλέγονται, Σάμιοι δὲ ἐπ᾽ ἑωϋτῶν μοῦνοι.
Οὗτοι χαρακτῆρες γλώσσης τέσσερες γίγνονται.</p>

<p>The words γλώσσης χαρακτὴρ (“distinctive mode of speech”) are
common to both these passages, but their meaning in the one and in
the other is to be measured by reference to the subject-matter of
which the author is speaking, as well as to the words which accompany
them,—especially the word βάρβαρος in the first passage. Nor can I
think (with Dr. Thirlwall) that the meaning of βάρβαρος is to be
determined by reference to the other two words: the reverse is, in my
judgment, correct. Βάρβαρος is a term definite and unequivocal, but
γλώσσης χαρακτὴρ varies according to the comparison which you happen
at the moment to be making, and its meaning is here determined by its
conjunction with βάρβαρος.</p>

<p>When Herodotus was speaking of the twelve Ionic cities in Asia,
he might properly point out the differences of speech among them as
so many different χαρακτῆρες γλώσσης: the limits of difference were
fixed by the knowledge which his hearers possessed of the persons
about whom he was speaking; the Ionians being all notoriously
Hellens. So an author, describing Italy, might say that Bolognese,
Romans, Neapolitans, Genoese, etc. had different χαρακτῆρες γλώσσης;
it being understood that the difference was such as might subsist
among persons all Italians.</p>

<p>But there is also a χαρακτῆρ γλώσσης of Greek generally
(abstraction made of its various dialects and diversities), as
contrasted with Persian, Phœnician, or Latin,—and of Italian
generally, as contrasted with German or English. It is this
comparison which Herodotus is taking, when he describes the language
spoken by the people of Krêstôn and Plakia, and which he notes by
the word βάρβαρον as opposed to Ἑλληνικόν: it is with reference to
this comparison that χαρακτῆρ γλώσσης, in the fifty-seventh chapter,
is to be construed. The word βάρβαρος is the usual and recognized
antithesis of Ἕλλην, or Ἑλληνικός.</p>

<p>It is not the least remarkable part of the statement of Herodotus,
that the language spoken at Krêstôn and at Plakia was the same,
though the places were so far apart from each other. This identity of
itself shows that he meant to speak of a substantive language, not of
a “strange jargon.”</p>

<p>I think it, therefore, certain that Herodotus pronounces the
Pelasgians of his day to speak a substantive language different from
Greek; but whether differing from it in a greater or less degree (<i>e.
g.</i> in the degree of Latin or of Phœnician), we have no means of
deciding.</p>

<p>The word Γραῖκες, in Alkman, meaning “the mothers of the
Hellenes,” may well be only a dialectic variety of γρᾶες, analogous
to κλᾲξ and ὄρνιξ, for κλεὶς, ὄρνις, etc. (Ahrens, De Dialecto
Doricâ, sect. 11, p. 91; and sect. 31, p. 242), perhaps declined like
γυναῖκες.</p>

<p>The term used by Sophoklês, if we may believe Photius, was not
Γραικὸς, but Ῥαικός (Photius, p. 480, 15; Dindorf, Fragment. Soph.
933: compare 455). Eustathius (p. 890) seems undecided between the
two.</p>

<p>There was an ancient religious ceremony, celebrated by the
Delphians every ninth year (Ennaëtêris): a procession was sent from
Delphi to the pass of Tempê, consisting of well-born youths under an
archi-theôr, who represented the proceeding ascribed by an old legend
to Apollo; that god was believed to have gone thither to receive
expiation after the slaughter of the serpent Pytho: at least, this
was one among several discrepant legends. The chief youth plucked
and brought back a branch from the sacred laurel at Tempê, as a
token that he had fulfilled his mission: he returned by “the sacred
road,” and broke his fast at a place called Δειπνιὰς, near Larissa.
A solemn festival, frequented by a large concourse of people from
the surrounding regions, was celebrated on this occasion at Tempê,
in honor of Apollo Tempeitês (Ἀπλοῦνι Τεμπείτᾳ, in the Æolic dialect
of Thessaly: see Inscript. in Boeckh, Corp. Ins. No. 1767). The
procession was accompanied by a flute-player.</p>

<p>See Plutarch, Quæst. Græc. ch. xi. p. 292; De Musicâ, ch. xiv. p.
1136, Ælian, V. II. iii. 1: Stephan. Byz. v. Δειπνιάς.</p>

<p>It is important to notice these religious processions as
establishing intercourse and sympathies between the distant members
of Hellas: but the inferences which O. Müller (Dorians, b. ii. 1, p.
222) would build upon them, as to the original seat of the Dorians
and the worship of Apollo, are not to be trusted.</p>

distinction made by Skylax (c. 61) and Diodorus (xviii. 11)
between Μηλιεῖς and Μαλιεῖς—the latter adjoining the former on the
north—appears inadmissible, though Letronne still defends it (Périple
de Marcien d’Héraclée, etc., Paris, 1839, p. 212).</p>

<p>Instead of Μαλιεῖς, we ought to read Λαμιεῖς, as O. Müller
observes (Dorians, i. 6, p. 48).</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the important town of Lamia (the modern
Zeitun) is not noticed either by Herodotus, Thucydidês, or Xenophon;
Skylax is the first who mentions it. The route of Xerxes towards
Thermopylæ lay along the coast from Alos.</p>

<p>The Lamieis (assuming that to be the correct reading) occupied
the northern coast of the Maliac gulf, from the north bank of the
Spercheius to the town of Echinus: in which position Dr. Cramer
places the Μηλιεῖς Παράλιοι—an error, I think (Geography of Greece,
vol. i. p. 436).</p>

<p>It is not improbable that Lamia first acquired importance during
the course of those events towards the close of the Peloponnesian
war, when the Lacedæmonians, in defence of Herakleia, attacked the
Achæans of Phthiôtis, and even expelled the Œtæans for a time from

military position came to be more valued than legendary celebrity
(Livy, xxviii. 6; Pausan. x. 1, 1; Skylax. c. 61-62); the latter
counts Thronium and Knêmis or Knêmides as being Phokian, not Lokrian;
which they were for a short time, during the prosperity of the

(Æschin. Fals. Legat. c. 42, p. 46). This serves as one presumption
about the age of the Periplus of Skylax (see the notes of Klausen ad

explanatory map. The two long and laborious tunnels constructed by
the old Orchomenians for the drainage of the lake, as an aid to the
insufficiency of the natural Katabothra, are there very clearly
laid down: one goes to the sea, the other into the neighboring lake
Hylika, which is surrounded by high rocky banks and can take more
water without overflowing. The lake Kôpaïs is an inclosed basin,
receiving all the water from Doris and Phokis through the Kêphisus.

Νομοθέτης δ᾽ αὐτοῖς (to the Thebans) ἐγένετο Φιλόλαος περί τ᾽ ἄλλων
τινῶν καὶ περὶ τῆς παιδοποιΐας, οὓς καλοῦσιν ἐκεῖνοι νόμους θετικούς·
καὶ τοῦτ᾽ ἐστὶν ἰδίως ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνου νενομοθετημένον, ὅπως ὁ ἀριθμὸς
σῴζηται τῶν κλήρων. A perplexing passage follows within three lines
of this,—Φιλολάου δὲ ἴδιον ἐστιν ἡ τῶν οὐσιῶν ἀνομάλωσις,—which
raises two questions: first, whether Philolaus can really be meant
in the second passage, which talks of what is ἴδιον to Philolaus,
while the first passage had already spoken of something ἰδίως
νενομοθετημένον by the same person. Accordingly, Göttling and M.
Barthélemy St. Hilaire follow one of the MSS. by writing Φαλέου
in place of Φιλολάου. Next, what is the meaning of ἀνομάλωσις? O.
Müller (Dorians, ch. x. 5, p. 209) considers it to mean a “fresh
equalization, just as ἀναδασμὸς means a fresh division,” adopting the
translation of Victorius and Schlösser.</p>

<p>The point can hardly be decisively settled; but if this
translation of ἀνομάλωσις be correct, there is good ground for
preferring the word Φαλέου to Φιλολάου; since the proceeding
described would harmonize better with the ideas of Phaleas (Aristot.

A crowd of five thousand Greeks, of every age and sex, had found
shelter in a grassy and bushy spot embosomed amidst these crags,—few
of them armed. They were pursued by five thousand Egyptians and
Arabians: a very small resistance, in such ground, would have kept
the troops at bay, but the poor men either could not or would not
offer it. They were forced to surrender: the youngest and most
energetic cast themselves headlong from the rocks and perished: three
thousand prisoners were carried away captive, and sold for slaves at
Corinth, Patras, and Modon: all those who were unfit for sale were
massacred on the spot by the Egyptian troops.</p>

<p id="Footnote_502"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_502">[502]</a></span> This story—that the heroic
ancestor of the great Corinthian Bacchiadæ had slain the holy
man Karnus, and had been punished for it by long banishment and
privation—leads to the conjecture, that the Corinthians did not
celebrate the festival of the Karneia, common to the Dorians
generally.</p>

<p>Herodotus tells us, with regard to the Ionic cities, that all
of them celebrated the festival of Apaturia, except Ephesus and
Kolophon; and that these two cities did not celebrate it, “because
of a certain reason of murder committed,”—οὗτοι γὰρ μοῦνοι Ἰώνων
οὐκ ἄγουσιν Ἀπατούρια· καὶ οὗτοι κατὰ φόνου τινὰ σκῆψιν (Herod. i.
147).</p>

<p>The murder of Karnus by Hippotês was probably the φόνου σκῆψις
which forbade the Corinthians from celebrating the Karneia; at least,
this supposition gives to the legend a special pertinence which is
otherwise wanting to it. Respecting the Karneia and Hyacinthia, see
Schoell De Origine Græci Dramatis, pp. 70-78. Tübingen, 1828.</p>

<p>There were various singular customs connected with the Grecian
festivals, which it was usual to account for by some legendary tale.
Thus, no native of Elis ever entered himself as a competitor, or
contended for the prize, at the Isthmian games. The legendary reason
given for this was, that Hêraklês had waylaid and slain (at Kleônæ)
the two Molionid brothers, when they were proceeding to the Isthmian
games as Theôrs or sacred envoys from the Eleian king Augeas. Redress
was in vain demanded for this outrage, and Molionê, mother of the
slain envoys, imprecated a curse upon the Eleians generally if they
should ever visit the Isthmian festival. This legend is the φόνου
σκῆψις, explaining why no Eleian runner or wrestler was ever known to
contend there (Pausan. ii. 15, 1; v. 2, 1-4. Ister, Fragment. 46, ed.
Didot).</p>

Andrôn positively affirms that the Dorians came from Histiæôtis to

<p>Aristotle (ap. Strab. viii. p. 374) appears to have believed that
the Herakleids returned to Argos out of the Attic Tetrapolis (where,
according to the Athenian legend, they had obtained shelter when
persecuted by Eurystheus), accompanying a body of Ionians who then
settled at Epidaurus. He cannot, therefore, have connected the Dorian

can hardly be justified in saying that the Argeians actually
<i>Dorized</i> Hermionê: it was Dryopian in the time of Herodotus, and
seemingly for a long time afterwards (Herodot. viii. 43). The
Hermionian Inscription, No. 1193, in Boeckh’s Collection, recognizes
their old Dryopian connection with Asinê in Laconia: that town had
once been neighbor of Hermionê, but was destroyed by the Argeians,
and the inhabitants received a new home from the Spartans. The
dialect of the Hermionians (probably that of the Dryopians generally)
was Doric. See Ahrens, De Dialecto Doricâ, pp. 2-12.</p>

<p>The Parian Marble makes Pheidôn the eleventh from Hêraklês,
and places him <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 895; Herodotus, on the
contrary (in a passage which affords considerable grounds for
discussion), places him at a period which cannot be much higher than
600 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> (vi. 127.) Some authors suspect the
text of Herodotus to be incorrect: at any rate, the real epoch of
Pheidôn is determined by the 8th Olympiad. Several critics suppose
<i>two</i> Pheidôns, each king of Argos,—among others, O. Müller (Dorians,
iii. 6, 10); but there is nothing to countenance this, except the
impossibility of reconciling Herodotus with the other authorities.
And Weissenborn, in a dissertation of some length, vindicates the
emendation of Pausanias proposed by some former critics,—altering
the 8th Olympiad, which now stands in the text of Pausanias, into
the <i>twenty-eighth</i>, as the date of Pheidôn’s usurpation at the
Olympic games. Weissenborn endeavors to show that Pheidôn cannot have
flourished earlier than 660 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; but his arguments
do not appear to me very forcible, and certainly not sufficient to
justify so grave an alteration in the number of Pausanias (Beiträge
zur Griechischen Alterthumskunde, p. 18, Jena, 1844). Mr. Clinton
(Fasti Hellenici, vol. i. App. 1, p. 249) places Pheidôn between 783
and 744 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; also, Boeckh. ad Corp. Inscript. No.

from Ephorus, Strabo, viii. pp. 361-365. Unfortunately, a portion
of the latter citation is incurably mutilated in the text: O.
Müller (History of the Dorians, book i. ch. v. 13) has proposed
an ingenious conjecture, which, however, cannot be considered as
trustworthy. Grosskurd, the German translator, usually skilful in
these restorations, leaves the passage untouched.</p>

<p>For a new coloring of the death of Kresphontês, adjusted by
Isokratês so as to suit the purpose of the address which he puts into
the mouth of Archidamus king of Sparta, see the discourse in his
works which passes under that name (Or. iv. pp. 120-122). Isokratês
says that the Messenian Dorians slew Kresphontês, whose children fled
as suppliants to Sparta, imploring revenge for the death of their
father, and surrendering the territory to the Spartans. The Delphian
god advised the latter to accept the tender, and they accordingly
attacked the Messenians, avenged Kresphontês, and appropriated the
territory.</p>

<p>Isokratês always starts from the basis of the old legend,—the
triple Dorian conquest made all at once: compare Panathenaic. Or.
xii. pp. 270-287.</p>

<p id="Footnote_558"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_558">[558]</a></span> Ephorus ap. Strabo, viii. p.
361. Dr. Thirlwall observes (History of Greece, ch. vii. p. 300,
2d edit.), “The Messenian Pylus seems long to have retained its
independence, and to have been occupied for several centuries by
one branch of the family of Neleus; for descendants of Nestor are
mentioned as allies of the Messenians in their struggle with Sparta
in the latter half of the seventh century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>”</p>

<p>For this assertion, Dr. Thirlwall cites Strabo (viii. p. 355).
I agree with him as to the matter of fact: I see no proof that the
Dorians of Stenyklêrus ever ruled over what is called the Messenian
Pylus; for, of course, if they did not rule over it before the second
Messenian war, they never acquired it at all. But on reference to
the passage in Strabo, it will not be found to prove anything to
the point; for Strabo is speaking, not of the Messenian Pylus, but
of the <i>Triphylian Pylus</i>: he takes pains to show that Nestor had
nothing to do with the <i>Messenian Pylus</i>,—Νέστορος ἀπόγονοι means the
inhabitants of Triphylia, near Lepreum: compare p. 350.</p>

Pausanias, iv. 34, 2; Strabo, viii. p. 361; and the observations

href="#FNanchor_560">[560]</a></span> See Mr. Clinton’s Chronological
Tables for the year 732 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; O. Müller (in the
Chronological Table subjoined to his History of the Dorians)
calls this victor, <i>Oxythemis of Korôneia</i>, in Bœotia. But this
is inadmissible, on two grounds: 1. The occurrence of a Bœotian
competitor in that early day at the Olympic games. The first eleven
victors (I put aside Oxythemis, because he is the subject of the
argument) are all from western and southern Peloponnesus; then come
victors from Corinth, Megara, and Epidaurus; then from Athens;
there is one from Thebes in the 41st Olympiad. I infer from hence
that the celebrity and frequentation of the Olympic games increased
only by degrees, and had not got beyond Peloponnesus in the eighth
century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 2. The name Coronæus, Κορωναῖος, is the
proper and formal title for a citizen of Korônê, not for a citizen
of Korôneia: the latter styles himself Κορωνεύς. The ethnical name
Κορωνεὺς, as belonging to Korôneia in Bœotia, is placed beyond doubt
by several inscriptions in Boeckh’s collection; especially No. 1583,
in which a citizen of that town is proclaimed as victorious at the
festival of the Charitesia at Orchomenus: compare Nos. 1587-1593, in
which the same ethnical name occurs. The Bœotian Inscriptions attest
in like manner the prevalence of the same etymological law in forming
ethnical names, for the towns near Korôneia: thus, <i>Chærôneia</i> makes
Χαιρωνεὺς; <i>Lebadeia</i>, Λεβαδεὺς; <i>Elateia</i>, Ἐλατεὺς, or Ἐλατειεύς.</p>

<p>The Inscriptions afford evidence perfectly decisive as to the
ethnical title under which a citizen of Korôneia in Bœotia would have
caused himself to be entered and proclaimed at the Olympic games;
better than the evidence of Herodotus and Thucydidês, who both call
them Κορωναῖοι (Herodot. v. 79; Thucyd. iv. 93): Polybius agrees with
the Inscription, and speaks of the Κορωνεῖς, Λεβαδεῖς, Χαιρωνεῖς
(xxvii. 1). O. Müller himself admits, in another place (Orchomenos,
p. 480), that the proper ethnical name is Κορωνεύς. The reading of
Strabo (ix. p. 411) is not trustworthy: see Grosskurd, <i>ad loc.</i>;
compare Steph. Byz. Κορώνεια and Κορώνη.</p>

<p>In regard to the formation of ethnical names, it seems the general
rule, that a town ending in η or αι, preceded by a consonant, had its
ethnical derivative in αιος; such as Σκιώνη, Τορώνη, Κύμη, Θῆβαι,
Ἀθῆναι; while names ending in εια had their ethnicon in ευς, as
Ἀλεξάνδρεια, Ἀμάσεια, Σελεύκεια, Λυσιμάχεια (the recent cities thus
founded by the successors of Alexander are perhaps the best evidences
that can be taken of the analogies of the language), Μελάμπεια,
Μελίτεια, in addition to the Bœotian names of towns above quoted.
There is, however, great irregularity in particular cases, and the
number of towns called by the same name created an anxiety to vary
the ethnicon for each: see Stephan. Byz. v. Ἡράκλεια.</p>

et Bœotorum dialecti tantum inter se distant, quantum vix ab aliâ

difference: “Contra tot tantasque differentias pauca reperiuntur
eaque fere levia, quæ utrique dialecto, neque simul Doricæ, communia
sint.... Vides his comparatis tantum interesse inter utramque
dialectum, ut dubitare liceat, an Æoles Bœoti non magis cum Æolibus

ii. 7, 1): compare v. 10, 3. See O. Müller (Hist. of Dorians, i. 7,
3).</p>

of Pisa (De Olympiis ap. Meursii Opp. vii. p. 128). It appears that
there existed a quoit at Olympia, upon which the formula of the
Olympic truce was inscribed, together with the names of Iphitus
and Lykurgus as the joint authors and proclaimers of it. Aristotle
believed this to be genuine, and accepted it as an evidence of the
fact which it professed to certify: and O. Müller is also disposed
to admit it as genuine,—that is, as <i>contemporary</i> with the times to
which it professes to relate. I come to a different conclusion: that
the quoit existed, I do not doubt; but that the inscription upon it
was actually set down in writing, in or near <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
880, would be at variance with the reasonable probabilities resulting
from Grecian palæography. Had this ancient and memorable instrument
existed at Olympia in the days of Herodotus, he could hardly have
assigned to Lykurgus the epoch which we now read in his writings.</p>

<p>The assertions in Müller’s History of the Dorians (i. 7, 7), about
Lykurgus, Iphitus, and Kleosthenês “drawing up the fundamental law of
the Olympic armistice,” are unsupported by any sufficient evidence.
In the later times of established majesty of the Olympic festival,
the Eleians did undoubtedly exercise the power which he describes;
but to connect this with any deliberate regulation of Iphitus and
Lykurgus, is in my judgment incorrect. See the mention of a similar
truce proclaimed throughout Triphylia by the Makistians as presidents
of the common festival at the temple of the Samian Poseidon (Strabo,
viii. p. 343).</p>

<p id="Footnote_572"><span class="label"><a

legislation of Lykurgus, “in conformity with Thucydidês,” at
about 817 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and his regency at 852
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, about thirty-five years previous (Fasti
Hellen. v. i. c. 7, p. 141): he also places the Olympiad of Iphitus
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 828 (F. H. vol. ii. p. 410; App. c. 22).</p>

<p>In that chapter, Mr. Clinton collects and discusses the various
statements respecting the date of Lykurgus: compare, also, Larcher ad
Herodot. i. 67, and Chronologie, pp. 486-492.</p>

<p>The differences in these statements must, after all, be taken
as they stand, for they cannot be reconciled except by the help of
arbitrary suppositions, which only mislead us by producing a show of
agreement where there is none in reality. I agree with Mr. Clinton,
in thinking that the assertion of Thucydidês is here to be taken as
the best authority. But I altogether dissent from the proceeding
which he (in common with Larcher, Wesseling, Sir John Marsham, and
others) employs with regard to the passage of Herodotus, where that
author calls Lykurgus the guardian and uncle of Labôtas (of the
Eurystheneid line). Mr. Clinton says: “From the notoriety of the
fact that Lycurgus was ascribed to the other house (the Prokleids),
it is manifest that <i>the passage must be corrupted</i>” (p. 144); and
he then goes on to correct the text of Herodotus, agreeably to the
proposition of Sir J. Marsham.</p>

<p>This proceeding seems to me inadmissible. The text of Herodotus
reads perfectly well, and is not contradicted by anything to be found
elsewhere <i>in Herodotus himself</i>: moreover, we have here a positive
guarantee of its accuracy, for Mr. Clinton himself admits that it
stood in the days of Pausanias just as we now read it (Pausan. iii.
2, 3). By what right, then, do we alter it? or what do we gain by
doing so? Our only right to do so, is, the assumption that there
must have been uniformity of belief and means of satisfactory
ascertainment, (respecting facts and persons of the ninth and tenth
centuries before the Christian era,) existing among Greeks of the
fifth and succeeding centuries; an assumption which I hold to be
incorrect. And all we gain is, an illusory unanimity produced by
gratuitously putting words into the mouth of one of our witnesses.</p>

<p>If we can prove Herodotus to have been erroneously informed, it is
right to do so; but we have no ground for altering his deposition.
It affords a clear proof that there were very different stories as
to the mere question, to which of the two lines of Herakleids the
Spartan lawgiver belonged,—and that there was an enormous difference
as to the time in which he lived.</p>

<p id="Footnote_581"><span class="label"><a

Rhetra—Διὸς Ἑλλανίου καὶ Ἀθηνᾶς Ἑλλανίας ἱερὸν ἱδρυσάμενον, φυλὰς
φυλάξαντα, καὶ ὠβὰς ὠβάξαντα, τριάκοντα, γερουσίαν σὺν ἀρχαγέταις,
καταστήσαντα, ὥρας ἐξ ὥρας ἀπελλάζειν μεταξὺ Βαβύκας καὶ Κνακίωνος,
οὕτως εἰσφέρειν τε καὶ ἀφίστασθαι· δάμῳ δ᾽ ἀγορὰν εἶμεν καὶ κράτος.
(Plutarch, <i>ib.</i>)</p>

<p>The reading ἀγορὰν (last word but three) is that of Coray’s
edition: other readings proposed are κυρίαν, ἀνωγὰν, ἀγορίαν, etc.
The MSS., however, are incurably corrupt, and none of the conjectures
can be pronounced certain.</p>

<p>The Rhetra contains various remarkable
archaisms,—ἀπελλάζειν—ἀφίστασθαι,—the latter word in the sense of
putting the question for decision, corresponding to the function of
the Ἀφεστὴρ at Knidus, (Plutarch, Quæst. Græc. c. 4; see Schneider,
Lexicon, <i>ad voc.</i>)</p>

<p>O. Müller connects τριάκοντα with ὠβὰς, and lays it down that
there were thirty Obes at Sparta: I rather agree with those critics
who place the comma after ὠβάξαντα, and refer the number thirty
to the senate. Urlichs, in his Dissertation Ueber Die Lykurgisch.
Rhetren (published in the Rheinisches Museum for 1847, p. 204),
introduces the word πρεσβυγενέας after τριάκοντα; which seems a
just conjecture, when we look to the addition afterwards made by
Theopompus. The statements of Müller about the Obes seem to me to
rest on no authority.</p>

<p>The word Rhetra means a solemn compact, either originally
emanating from, or subsequently sanctioned by, the gods, who are
always parties to such agreements: see the old Treaty between the
Eleians and Heræans,—Ἁ ϝράτρα, between the two,—commemorated in
the valuable inscription still preserved,—as ancient, according to
Boeckh, as Olymp. 40-60, (Boeckh, Corp. Inscript. No. 2, p. 26, part
i.) The words of Tyrtæus imply such a compact between contracting
parties: first the kings, then the senate, lastly the people—εὐθείαις
ῥήτραις <em class="gesperrt">ἀνταπαμειβομένους</em>—where the
participle last occurring applies not to the people alone, but to all
the three. The Rhetra of Lykurgus emanated from the Delphian god;
but the kings, senate, and people all bound themselves, both to each
other and to the gods, to obey it. The explanations given of the
phrase by Nitzsch and Schömann (in Dr. Thirlwall’s note, ch. viii. p.
334) seem to me less satisfactory than what appears in C. F. Hermann
(Lehrbuch der Griech. Staatsalterthümer, s. 23).</p>

<p>Nitzsch (Histor. Homer. sect. xiv. pp. 50-55) does not take
sufficient account of the distinction between the meaning of ῥήτρα in
the early and in the later times. In the time of the Ephor Epitadeus,
or of Agis the Third, he is right in saying that ῥήτρα is equivalent
to <i>scitum</i>,—still, however, with an idea of greater solemnity and
unchangeability than is implied in the word νόμος, analogous to
what is understood by a fundamental or organic enactment in modern
ideas. The old ideas, of a mandate from the Delphian god, and a
compact between the kings and the citizens, which had once been
connected with the word, gradually dropped away from it. There is no
contradiction in Plutarch, therefore, such as that to which Nitzsch
alludes (p. 54).</p>

<p>Kopstadt’s Dissertation (pp. 22, 30) touches on the same subject.
I agree with Kopstadt (Dissert. pp. 28-30), in thinking it probable
that Plutarch copied the words of the old Lykurgean constitutional
Rhetra, from the account given by Aristotle of the Spartan polity.</p>

<p>King Theopompus probably brought from the Delphian oracle the
important rider which he tacked to the mandate as originally brought
by Lykurgus—οἱ βασιλεῖς Θεόπομπος καὶ Πολύδωρος τάδε τῇ ῥήτρᾳ
παρενέγραψαν. The authority of the oracle, together with their own
influence, would enable them to get these words accepted by the
people.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_582"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_582">[582]</a></span> Αἲ δὲ σκολιὰν ὁ δᾶμος ἕλοιτο,
τοὺς πρεσβυγενέας καὶ ἀρχαγέτας ἀποστατῆρας εἶμεν. (Plutarch,
<i>ib.</i>)</p>

<p>Plutarch tells us that the primitive Rhetra, anterior to this
addition, specially enjoined the assembled citizens either to adopt
or reject, without change, the Rhetra proposed by the kings and
senate, and that the rider was introduced because the assembly had
disobeyed this injunction, and adopted amendments of its own. It
is this latter sense which he puts on the word σκολιὰν. Urlichs
(Ueber Lyc. Rhetr. p. 232) and Nitzsch (Hist. Homer. p. 54) follow
him, and the latter even construes the epithet Εὐθείαις ῥήτραις
ἀνταπαμειβομένους of Tyrtæus in a corresponding sense: he says,
“Populus iis (rhetris) εὐθείαις, i. e. <i>nihil inflexis</i>, suffragari
jubetur: nam lex cujus Tyrtæus admonet, ita sanxerat—si populus
rogationem <i>inflexam</i> (<i>i. e.</i> non nisi ad suum arbitrium immutatam)
accipere voluerit, senatores et auctores abolento totam.”</p>

<p>Now, in the first place, it seems highly improbable that the
primitive Rhetra, with its antique simplicity, would contain any
such preconceived speciality of restriction upon the competence of
the assembly. That restriction received its formal commencement only
from the rider annexed by king Theopompus, which evidently betokens
a previous dispute and refractory behavior on the part of the
assembly.</p>

<p>In the second place, the explanation which these authors give of
the words σκολιὰν and εὐθείαις, is not conformable to the ancient
Greek, as we find it in Homer and Hesiod: and these early analogies
are the proper test, seeing that we are dealing with a very ancient
document. In Hesiod, ἰθὺς and σκολιὸς are used in a sense which
almost exactly corresponds to <i>right</i> and <i>wrong</i> (which words,
indeed, in their primitive etymology, maybe traced back to the
meaning of <i>straight</i> and <i>crooked</i>). See Hesiod. Opp. Di. 36, 192,
218, 221, 226, 230, 250, 262, 264; also Theogon. 97, and Fragm. 217,
ed. Göttling; where the phrases are constantly repeated, ἰθεῖαι
δίκαι, σκολιαὶ δίκαι, σκολιοὶ μῦθοι. There is also the remarkable
expression, Opp. Di. 9. ῥεῖα δέ τ᾽ ἰθύνει σκολιὸν: compare v. 263.
ἰθύνετε μύθους: also Homer, Iliad, xvi. 387. Οἳ βίῃ εἰν ἀγορῇ σκολιὰς
κρίνωσι θέμιστας; and xxiii. 580. ἰθεῖα; xviii. 508. ὃς μετὰ τοῖσι
δίκην ἰθύντατα εἴπῃ, etc.</p>

<p>If we judge by these analogies, we shall see that the words
of Tyrtæus, εὐθείαις ῥήτραις, mean “<i>straightforward</i>, <i>honest</i>,
statutes or conventions”—not <i>propositions adopted without change</i>,
as Nitzsch supposes. And so the words σκολιὰν ἕλοιτο, mean, “adopt a
<i>wrong or dishonest determination</i>,”—not a determination different
from what was proposed to them.</p>

<p>These words gave to the kings and senate power to cancel any
decision of the public assembly which they disapproved. It retained
only the power of refusing assent to some substantive propositions
of the authorities, first of the kings and senate, afterwards of the
ephors. And this limited power it seems always to have preserved.</p>

<p>Kopstadt explains well the expression σκολιὰν, as the antithesis
to the epithet of Tyrtæus, εὐθείαις ῥήτραις (Dissertat. sect. 15, p.
124).</p>

<p>M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire, in his note to the passage of
Aristotle, presumes that they were of course chosen in the same
manner as the senators; but there seems no sufficient ground in
Aristotle to countenance this. Nor is it easy to reconcile the words
of Aristotle respecting the election of the senators, where he
assimilates it to an αἵρεσις δυναστευτικὴ (Polit. v. 5, 8; ii. 6,

<p>Plato, in his Republic, in like manner disapproves of any general
enactments, tying up beforehand the discretion of perfectly educated
men, like his guardians, who will always do what is best on each
special occasion (Republic, iv. p. 425).</p>

<p id="Footnote_606"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_606">[606]</a></span> Besides the primitive
constitutional Rhetra mentioned above, page 345, various other Rhetræ
are also attributed to Lykurgus: and Plutarch singles out three under
the title of “The Three Rhetræ,” as if they were either the only
genuine Lykurgean Rhetræ, or at least stood distinguished by some
peculiar sanctity from all others (Plutarch, Quæst. Roman. c. 87.
Agesilaus, c. 26).</p>

<p>These three were (Plutarch, Lycurg. c. 13; comp. Apophth. Lacon.
p. 227): 1. Not to resort to written laws. 2. Not to employ in
house-building any other tools than the axe and the saw. 3. Not to
undertake military expeditions often against the same enemies.</p>

<p>I agree with Nitzsch (Histor. Homer. pp. 61-65) that these
Rhetræ, though doubtless not actually Lykurgean, are, nevertheless,
ancient (that is, probably dating somewhere between 650-550
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) and not the mere fictions of recent
writers, as Schömann (Ant. Jur. Pub. iv. 1; xiv. p. 132) and Urlichs
(p. 241) seem to believe. And though Plutarch specifies the number
<i>three</i>, yet there seems to have been still more, as the language of
Tyrtæus must be held to indicate: out of which, from causes which we
do not now understand, the three which Plutarch distinguishes excited
particular notice.</p>

<p>These maxims or precepts of state were probably preserved along
with the dicta of the Delphian oracle, from which authority,
doubtless, many of them may have emanated,—such as the famous ancient
prophecy Ἁ φιλοχρηματία Σπάρταν ὁλεῖ, ἄλλο δὲ οὐδὲν (Krebs, Lectiones
Diodoreæ, p. 140. Aristotel. Περὶ Πολιτειῶν, ap. Schol. ad Eurip.
Andromach. 446. Schömann, Comm. ad Plutarch. Ag. et Cleomen. p.
123).</p>

<p>Nitzsch has good remarks in explanation of the prohibition against
“using written laws.” This prohibition was probably called forth by
the circumstance that other Grecian states were employing lawgivers
like Zaleukus, Drako, Charondas, or Solon,—to present them, at once,
with a series of written enactments, or provisions. Some Spartans
may have proposed that an analogous lawgiver should be nominated for
Sparta: upon which proposition a negative was put in the most solemn
manner possible, by a formal Rhetra, perhaps passed after advice from
Delphi. There is no such contradiction, therefore, (when we thus
conceive the event,) as some authors represent, in forbidding the use
of written laws by a Rhetra itself, put into writing. To employ a
phrase in greater analogy with modern controversies—“The Spartans, on
the direction of the oracle, resolve to retain their unwritten common
law, and not to codify.”</p>

in the mind of the Spartan authorities. Αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ ἐγγύτατα τῶν
περιοίκων (Thucyd. iv. 8), who are ready before the rest, and march
against the Athenians at Pylus, probably include the Amyklæans.</p>

<p>Laconia generally is called by Thucydidês (iii. 16) as the
περιοικὶς of Sparta.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_629"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_629">[629]</a></span> The word περίοικοι is sometimes
used to signify simply “surrounding neighbor states,” in its natural
geographical sense: see Thucyd. i. 17, and Aristot. Polit. ii. 7,
1.</p>

<p>But the more usual employment of it is, to mean, the unprivileged
or less privileged members of the same political aggregate living
without the city, in contrast with the full-privileged burghers who
lived within it. Aristotle uses it to signify, in Krête, the class
corresponding to the Lacedæmonian Helots (Pol. ii. 7, 3): there
did not exist in Krête any class corresponding to the Lacedæmonian
Periœki. In Krête, there were not two stages of inferiority,—there
was only one, and that one is marked by the word περίοικοι; while the
Lacedæmonian Periœkus had the Helot below him. To an Athenian the
word conveyed the idea of undefined degradation.</p>

<p>To understand better the <i>status</i> of the Periœkus, we may contrast
him with the Metœkus, or Metic. The latter resides in the city,
but he is an alien resident on sufferance, not a native: he pays a
special tax, stands excluded from all political functions, and cannot
even approach the magistrate except through a friendly citizen, or
Prostatês (επὶ προστάτον οἰκεῖν—Lycurgus cont. Leocrat. c. 21-53):
he bears arms for the defence of the state. The situation of a
Metic was, however, very different in different cities of Greece.
At Athens, that class were well-protected in person and property,
numerous and domiciliated: at Sparta, there were at first none,—the
Xenêlasy excluded them; but this must have been relaxed long before
the days of Agis the Third.</p>

<p>The Periœkus differs from the Metic, in being a native of the
soil, subject by birth to the city law.</p>

<p>M. Kopstadt (in his Dissertation above cited, on Lacedæmonian
affairs, sect. 7, p. 60) expresses much surprise at that which I
advance in this note respecting Krête and Lacedæmon,—that in Krête
there was no class of men analogous to the Lacedæmonian Periœki, but
only two classes,—<i>i. e.</i> free citizens and Helots. He thinks that
this position is “prorsus falsum.”</p>

<p>But I advance nothing more here than what is distinctly stated by
Aristotle, as Kopstadt himself admits (pp. 60, 71). Aristotle calls
the subject class in Krête by the name of Περίοικοι. And in this
case, the general presumptions go far to sustain the authority of
Aristotle. For Sparta was a dominant or capital city, including in
its dependence not only a considerable territory, but a considerable
number of inferior, distinct, organized townships. In Krête, on
the contrary, each autonomous state included only a town with its
circumjacent territory, but without any annexed townships. There
was, therefore, no basis for the intermediate class called, in
Laconia, Periœki: just as Kopstadt himself remarks (p. 78) about
the Dorian city of Megara. There were only the two classes of free
Krêtan citizens, and serf-cultivators in various modifications and
subdivisions.</p>

<p>Kopstadt (following Hoeck, Krêta, b. iii. vol. iii. p. 23) says
that the authority of Aristotle on this point is overborne by that
of Dosiadas and Sosikratês,—authors who wrote specially on Krêtan
affairs. Now if we were driven to make a choice, I confess that I
should prefer the testimony of Aristotle,—considering that we know
little or nothing respecting the other two. But in this case I do
not think that we are driven to make a choice: Dosiadas (ap. Athenæ.
xiv. p. 143) is not cited in terms, so that we cannot affirm him to
contradict Aristotle: and Sosikratês (upon whom Hoeck and Kopstadt
rely) says something which does not necessarily contradict him, but
admits of being explained so as to place the two witnesses in harmony
with each other.</p>

<p>Sosikratês says (ap. Athenæ. vi. p. 263), Τὴν μὲν κοινὴν δουλείαν
οἱ Κρῆτες καλοῦσι μνοίαν, τὴν δὲ ἰδίαν ἀφαμίωτας, τοὺς δὲ περιοίκους
ὑπηκόους. Now the word περιοίκους seems to be here used just as
Aristotle would have used it, to comprehend the Krêtan serfs
universally: it is not distinguished from μνώιται and ἀφαμιῶται,
but comprehends both of them as different species under a generic
term. The authority of Aristotle affords a reason for preferring to
construe the passage in this manner, and the words appear to me to
admit of it fairly.</p>

on the Spartan Constitution, appended to the first volume of his
Thucydidês, p. 643) places greater confidence in the historical value
of this narrative of Isokratês than I am inclined to do. On the other
hand, Mr. G. C. Lewis, in his Review of Dr. Arnold’s Dissertation
(Philological Museum, vol. ii. p. 45), considers the “account of
Isokratês as completely inconsistent with that of Ephorus;” which
is saying rather more, perhaps, than the tenor of the two strictly
warrants. In Mr. Lewis’s excellent article, most of the difficult
points respecting the Spartan constitution will be found raised and
discussed in a manner highly instructive.</p>

<p>Another point in the statement of Isokratês is, that the Dorians,
at the time of the original conquest of Laconia, were only two
thousand in number (Or. xii. Panath. p. 286). Mr. Clinton rejects
this estimate as too small, and observes, “I suspect that Isokratês,
in describing the numbers of the Dorians at the original conquest,
has adapted to the description the actual numbers of the Spartans in
his own time.” (Fast. Hellen. ii. p. 408.)</p>

<p>This seems to me a probable conjecture, and it illustrates as well
the absence of data under which Isokratês or his informants labored,
as the method which they took to supply the deficiency.</p>

Dissertation which I have before alluded to, De Rerum Laconicarum
Constitutionis Lycurgeæ Origine et Indole, cap. ii. p. 31)
controverts this position respecting the Periœki. He appears to
understand it in a sense which my words hardly present,—at least, a
sense which I did not intend them to present: as if the majority of
inhabitants in <i>each</i> of the hundred Periœkic towns were Dorians,—“ut
per centum Laconiæ oppida distributi <i>ubique majorem</i> incolarum
numerum efficerent,” (p. 32.) I meant only to affirm that some of
the Periœkic towns, such as Amyklæ, were wholly, or almost wholly,
Dorian; many others of them partially Dorian. But what may have been
the comparative numbers (probably different in each town) of Dorian
and non-Dorian inhabitants,—there are no means of determining. M.
Kopstadt (p. 35) admits that Amyklæ, Pharis, and Geronthræ, were
Periœkic towns peopled by Dorians; and if this be true, it negatives
the general maxim on the faith of which he contradicts what I affirm:
his maxim is—“nunquam Dorienses à Doriensibus nisi bello victi erant,
civitate æquoque jure privati sunt,” (p. 31.) It is very unsafe to
lay down such large positions respecting a supposed uniformity of
Dorian rules and practice. The high authority of O. Müller has been
extremely misleading in this respect.</p>

<p>It is plain that Herodotus (compare his expression, viii. 73
and i. 145) conceived all the free inhabitants of Laconia not as
Achæans, but as Dorians. He believes in the story of the legend,
that the Achæans, driven out of Laconia by the invading Dorians
and Herakleidæ, occupied the territory in the north-west of
Peloponnesus which was afterwards called Achæa,—expelling from
it the Ionians. Whatever may be the truth about this legendary
statement,—and whatever may have been the original proportions
of Dorians and Achæans in Laconia,—these two races had (in the
fifth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) become confounded in one
undistinguishable ethnical and political aggregate called Laconian,
or Lacedæmonian,—comprising both Spartans and Periœki, though with
very unequal political franchises, and very material differences in
individual training and habits. The case was different in Thessaly,
where the Thessalians held in dependence Magnêtes, Perrhæbi, and
Achæans: the separate nationality of these latter was never lost.</p>

γὰρ τὸ τῶν Σπαρτιατῶν εἶναι τὴν πλείστην γῆν, οὐκ ἐξετάζουσιν ἀλλήλων
τὰς εἰσφοράς.</p>

<p>Mr. G. C. Lewis, in the article above alluded to (Philolog. Mus.
ii. p. 54), says, about the Periœki: “They lived in the country or
in small towns of the Laconian territory, and cultivated the land,
which they did not hold of any individual citizen, but paid for it a
tribute or rent to the state; being exactly in the same condition as
the <i>possessores</i> of the Roman domain, or the Ryots, in Hindostan,
before the introduction of the Permanent Settlement.” It may be
doubted, I think, whether the Periœki paid any such rent or tribute
as that which Mr. Lewis here supposes. The passage just cited from
Aristotle seems to show that they paid direct taxation individually,
and just upon the same principle as the Spartan citizens, who are
distinguished only by being larger landed-proprietors. But though
the principle of taxation be the same, there was practical injustice
(according to Aristotle) in the mode of assessing it. “The Spartan
citizens (he observes) being the largest landed-proprietors,
take care not to canvass strictly <i>each other’s payment of
property-tax</i>”—<i>i. e.</i> they wink mutually at each other’s evasions.
If the Spartans had been the <i>only</i> persons who paid εἰσφορὰ, or
property-tax, this observation of Aristotle would have had no
meaning. In principle, the tax was assessed, both on their larger
properties and on the smaller properties of the Periœki: in practice,
the Spartans helped each other to evade the due proportion.</p>

was in great immediate want of money, and he raised, by this means,
five hundred talents. Six thousand Helots must thus have been in a
condition to find five minæ each, which was a very considerable sum
(Plutarch, Kleomenes, c. 23).</p>

<p id="Footnote_649"><span class="label"><a

intoxication (Plutarch, Lycurg. c. 28; also, Adversus Stoicos de

<p>O. Müller seems to consider that the light-armed, who attended
the Periœkic hoplites at Platæa, were <i>not</i> Helots (Dor. iii. 3,
6). Herodotus does not distinctly say that they were so, but I see
no reason for admitting two different classes of light-armed in the
Spartan military force.</p>

<p>The calculation which Müller gives of the number of Periœki and
Helots altogether, proceeds upon very untrustworthy data. Among
them is to be noticed his supposition that πολιτικὴ χώρα means the
district of Sparta as distinguished from Laconia, which is contrary
to the passage in Polybius (vi. 45): πολιτικὴ χώρα, in Polybius,
means the territory of the state generally.</p>

<p id="Footnote_662"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_662">[662]</a></span> It is remarkable that these
violent contentions of the youth, wherein kicking, biting, gouging
out each other’s eyes, was resorted to,—as well as the διαμαστίγωσις,
or scourging-match, before the altar of Artemis,—lasted down to the
closing days of Sparta, and were actually seen by Cicero, Plutarch,
and even Pausanias. Plutarch had seen several persons die under the
suffering (Plutarch, Lykurg. c. 16, 18-30; and Instituta Laconica, p.
239; Pausan. iii. 14, 9, 16, 7; Cicero, Tuscul. Disp. ii. 15).</p>

<p>The voluntary tortures, undergone by the young men among the
Mandan tribe of Indians, at their annual religious festival, in the
presence of the elders of the tribe,—afford a striking illustration
of the same principles and tendencies as this Spartan διαμαστίγωσις.
They are endured partly under the influence of religious feelings,
as an acceptable offering to the Great Spirit,—partly as a point of
emulation and glory on the part of the young men, to show themselves
worthy and unconquerable in the eyes of their seniors. The intensity
of these tortures is, indeed, frightful to read, and far surpasses
in that respect anything ever witnessed at Sparta. It would be
incredible, were it not attested by a trustworthy eye-witness.</p>

<p>See Mr. Catlin’s Letters on the North American Indians, Letter 22,
vol. i. p. 157, <i>seq.</i></p>

<p>“These religious ceremonies are held, in part, for the purpose of
conducting all the young men of the tribe, as they annually arrive
at manhood, through an ordeal of privation and torture; which, while
it is supposed to harden their muscles and prepare them for extreme
endurance,—enables the chiefs who are spectators of the scene, to
decide upon their comparative bodily strength and ability, to endure
the extreme privations and sufferings that often fall to the lot of
Indian warriors; and that they may decide who is the most hardy and
best able to lead a war-party in case of emergency.”—Again, p. 173,
etc.</p>

<p>The καρτερία or power of endurance (Aristot. Pol. ii. 6, 5-16)
which formed one of the prominent objects of the Lycurgean training,
dwindles into nothing compared to that of the Mandan Indians.</p>

probably had formed to himself exaggerated notions of what their
courage under such circumstances ought to have been, as the result of
their peculiar training. We may add that their violent demonstrations
on that trying occasion may well have arisen quite as much from the
agony of wounded honor as from fear, when we consider what an event
the appearance of a conquering army in Sparta was.</p>

<p>Aristotle (ii. 6, 10) states that it was discreditable to buy
or sell a lot of land, but that the lot might be either given or
bequeathed at pleasure. He mentions nothing about the prohibition to
divide, and even states what contradicts it,—that it was the practice
to give a large dowry when a rich man’s daughter married (ii. 6, 11).
The sister of Agesilaus, Kyniska, was a person of large property,
which apparently implies the division of his father’s estate
(Plutarch, Agesilaus, 30).</p>

<p>Whether there was ever any law prohibiting a father from dividing
his lot among his children, may well be doubted. The Rhetra of the
ephor Epitadeus (Plutarch, Agis, 5), granted unlimited power of
testamentary disposition to the possessor, so that he might give
away or bequeathe his land to a stranger if he chose. To this law
great effects are ascribed: but it is evident that the tendency to
accumulate property in few hands, and the tendency to diminution in
the number of qualified citizens, were powerfully manifested before
the time of Epitadeus, who came after Lysander. Plutarch, in another
place, notices Hesiod, Xenokrates, and Lykurgus, as having concurred
with Plato, in thinking that it was proper to leave only one single
heir (ἕνα μόνον κληρόνομον καταλιπεῖν) (Ὑπομνήματα εἰς Ἡσίοδον,
Fragm. vol. v. p. 777, Wyttenb.). But Hesiod does not lay down this
as a necessity or as a universal rule; he only says, that a man is
better off who has only one son (Opp. Di. 374). And if Plato had
been able to cite Lykurgus as an authority for that system of an
invariable number of separate κλῆροι, or lots, which he sets forth in
his treatise De Legibus (p. 740), it is highly probable that he would
have done so. Still less can Aristotle have supposed that Lykurgus
or the Spartan system either insured, or intended to insure, the
maintenance of an unalterable number of distinct proprietary lots;
for he expressly notices that scheme as a peculiarity of Philolaus
the Corinthian, in his laws for the Thebans (Polit. ii. 9, 7).</p>

<p>Perhaps, as O. Müller remarks, this may mean only, that none
except the eldest brother could afford to marry; but the feelings
of the Spartans in respect to marriage were, in many other points,
so different from ours, that we are hardly authorized to reject
the literal statement (History of the Dorians, iii. 10, 2),—which,
indeed, is both illustrated and rendered credible by the permission
granted in the laws of Solôn to an ἐπίκληρος who had been claimed in
marriage by a relative in his old age,—ἂν ὁ κρατῶν καὶ κύριος γεγονὼς

his opinion is, probably, borrowed from these same authors, of the

surprise, how the best-informed ancient authors (οἱ λογιώτατοι τῶν
ἀρχαίων συγγραφέων), Plato, Xenophon, Ephorus, Kallisthenês, can
compare the Kretan polity to the old Lacedæmonian, the main features

at Sparta, great inequality of property in Krete, among other
differences (Polyb. vi. 45-48).</p>

<p>C. F. Hermann, on the contrary, considers the equal partition
of Laconia into lots indivisible and inalienable, as “an essential
condition” (eine wesentliche Bedingung) of the whole Lykurgean system
(Lehrbuch der Griechischen Staatsalterthümer, sect. 28).</p>

<p>Tittmann (Griechische Staatsverfassungen, pp. 588-596) states
and seems to admit the equal partition as a fact, without any
commentary.</p>

<p>Wachsmuth (Hellenisch. Alterthumskunde, v. 4, 42, p. 217) supposes
“that the best land was already parcelled, before the time of
Lykurgus, into lots of equal magnitude, corresponding to the number
of Spartans, which number afterwards increased to nine thousand.”
For this assertion, I know no evidence: it departs from Plutarch,
without substituting anything better authenticated or more plausible.
Wachsmuth notices the partition of Laconia among the Periœki in
thirty thousand equal lots, without any comment, and seemingly as if
there were no doubt of it (p. 218).</p>

<p>Manso, also, supposes that there had once been an equal division
of land prior to Lykurgus,—that it had degenerated into abuse,—and
that Lykurgus corrected it, restoring, not absolute equality, but
something near to equality (Manso, Sparta, vol. i. pp. 110-121). This
is the same gratuitous supposition as that of Wachsmuth.</p>

<p>O. Müller admits the division as stated by Plutarch, though he
says that the whole number of nine thousand lots cannot have been
set out before the Messenian war; and he adheres to the idea of
equality as contained in Plutarch; but he says that the equality
consisted in “equal estimate of average produce,”—not in equal
acreable dimensions. He goes so far as to tell us that “the lots of
the Spartans, which supported twice as many men as the lots of the
Periœki, must, upon the whole, have been twice as extensive (<i>i. e.</i>
in the aggregate): each lot must, therefore, have been seven times
greater,” (compare History of the Dorians, iii. 3, 6; iii. 10, 2.) He
also supposes, that “similar partitions of land had been made from
the time of the first occupation of Laconia by the Dorians.” Whoever
compares his various positions with the evidence brought to support
them, will find a painful disproportion between the basis and the
superstructure.</p>

<p>The views of Schömann, as far as I collect from expressions
somewhat vague, seem to coincide with those of Dr. Thirlwall. He
admits, however that the alleged Lykurgean equalization is at
variance with the representations of Plato (Schömann, Antiq. Jur.
Pub. iv. 1, 7, note 4, p. 116).</p>

<p id="Footnote_703"><span class="label"><a

in M. Kopstadt’s Dissertation, that the general conclusion which
I have endeavored to establish respecting the alleged Lykurgean
redivision of property, appears to him successfully proved. (Dissert.
De Rerum Laconic. Const. sect. 18, p. 138.)</p>

<p>He supposes, with perfect truth, that, at the time when the first
edition of these volumes was published, I was ignorant of the fact,
that Lachmann and Kortüm had both called in question the reality of
the Lykurgean redivision. In regard to Professor Kortüm, the fact was
first brought to my knowledge, by his notice of these two volumes, in
the Heidelberger Jahrbücher, 1846, No. 41, p. 649.</p>

<p>Since the first edition, I have read the treatise of Lachmann
(Die Spartanische Staats Verfassung in ihrer Entwicklung und ihrem
Verfalle, sect. 10, p. 170) wherein the redivision ascribed to
Lykurgus is canvassed. He, too, attributes the origin of the tale, as
a portion of history, to the social and political feelings current
in the days of Agis the Third, and Kleomenês the Third. He notices,
also, that it is in contradiction with Plato and Isokratês. But
a large proportion of the arguments which he brings to disprove
it, are connected with ideas of his own respecting the social and
political constitution of Sparta, which I think either untrue or
uncertified. Moreover, he believes in the inalienability as well as
the indivisibility of the separate lots of land,—which I believe to
be just as little correct as their supposed equality.</p>

<p>Kopstadt (p. 139) thinks that I have gone too far in rejecting
every middle opinion. He thinks that Lykurgus must have done
something, though much less than what is affirmed, tending to realize
equality of individual property.</p>

<p>I shall not say that this is impossible. If we had ampler
evidence, perhaps such facts might appear. But as the evidence stands
now, there is nothing whatever to show it. Nor are we entitled (in
my judgment) to presume that it was so, in the absence of evidence,
simply in order to make out that the Lykurgean mythe is only an
exaggeration, and not entire fiction.</p>

<p id="Footnote_712"><span class="label"><a

agrees, in the main, with that of Manso and O. Müller (Manso, Sparta,
vol. i. pp. 118-128; and vol. ii. Beilage, 9, p. 129; and Müller,
History of the Dorians, vol. ii. b. iii. c. 10, sect. 2, 3).</p>

<p>Both these authors maintain the proposition stated by Plutarch
(Agis c. 5, in his reference to the ephor Epitadeus, and the new
law carried by that ephor), that the number of Spartan lots, nearly
equal and rigorously indivisible, remained with little or no change
from the time of the original division, down to the return of
Lysander, after his victorious close of the Peloponnesian war. Both
acknowledge that they cannot understand by what regulations this long
unalterability, so improbable in itself, was maintained: but both
affirm the fact positively. The period will be more than four hundred
years if the original division be referred to Lykurgus: more than
three hundred years, if the nine thousand lots are understood to date
from the Messenian war.</p>

<p>If this alleged fact be really a fact, it is something almost
without a parallel in the history of mankind: and before we consent
to believe it, we ought at least to be satisfied that there is
considerable show of positive evidence in its favor, and not much
against it. But on examining Manso and Müller, it will be seen that
not only is there very slender evidence in its favor,—there is a
decided balance of evidence against it.</p>

<p>The evidence produced to prove the indivisibility of the Spartan
lot, is a passage of Herakleidês Ponticus, c. 2 (ad. calc. Cragii, p.
504), πωλεῖν δὲ γὴν Λακεδαιμονίοις αἰσχρὸν νενόμισται,—τῆς ἀρχαίας
μοίρας ἀνανέμεσθαι (or νενεμῆσθαι) οὐδὲν ἔξεστι. The first portion
of this assertion is confirmed by, and probably borrowed from,
Aristotle, who says the same thing, nearly in the same words: the
second portion of the sentence ought, according to all reasonable
rules of construction, to be understood with reference to the first
part; that is, to the <i>sale</i> of the original lot. “To sell land,
is held disgraceful among the Lacedæmonians, nor is it permitted
to sever off any portion of the original lot,” i. e. <i>for sale</i>.
Herakleidês is not here speaking of the law of <i>succession</i> to
property at Lacedæmon, nor can we infer from his words that the whole
lot was transmitted entire to one son. No evidence except this very
irrelevant sentence is produced by Müller and Manso to justify their
positive assertion, that the Spartan lot of land was indivisible in
respect to inheritance.</p>

<p>Having thus determined the indivisible transmission of lots to
one son of a family, Manso and Müller presume, without any proof,
that that son must be the eldest: and Müller proceeds to state
something equally unsupported by proof: “The extent of his rights,
however, was perhaps no farther than that he was considered master
of the house and property; while the other members of the family had
an equal right to the enjoyment of it.... The master of the family
was, therefore, obliged to contribute for all these to the syssitia,
without which contribution no one was admitted.”—pp. 199, 200.</p>

<p>All this is completely gratuitous, and will be found to produce as
many difficulties in one way as it removes in another.</p>

<p>The next law as to the transmission of property, which Manso
states to have prevailed, is, that all daughters were to marry
without receiving any dowry,—the case of a sole daughter is here
excepted. For this proposition he cites Plutarch, Apophtheg. Laconic.
p. 227; Justin, iii. 3; Ælian. V. H. vi. 6. These authors do
certainly affirm, that there was such a regulation, and both Plutarch
and Justin assign reasons for it, real or supposed. “Lykurgus,
being asked why he directed that maidens should be married without
dowry, answered,—In order that maidens of poor families might not
remain unmarried, and that character and virtue might be exclusively
attended to in the choice of a wife.” The same general reason is
given by Justin. Now the <i>reason</i> here given for the prohibition of
dowry, goes, indirectly, to prove that there existed no such law of
general succession, as that which had been before stated, namely, the
sacred indivisibility of the primitive lot. For had this latter been
recognized, the reason would have been obvious why daughters could
receive no dowry; the father’s whole landed property (and a Spartan
could have little of any other property, since he never acquired
anything by industry) was under the strictest entail to his eldest
son. Plutarch and Justin, therefore, while in their statement as to
the matter of fact, they warrant Manso in affirming the prohibition
of dowry (about this matter of fact, more presently), do, by the
reason which they give, discountenance his former supposition as to
the indivisibility of the primitive family lots.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Manso understands Aristotle (Polit. ii. 6, 11), by the
use of the adverb νῦν, to affirm something respecting his own time
specially, and to imply at the same time that the ancient custom had
been the reverse. I cannot think that the adverb, as Aristotle uses
it in that passage, bears out such a construction: νῦν δὲ, there,
does not signify present time as opposed to past, but the antithesis
between the actual custom and that which Aristotle pronounces to be
expedient. Aristotle gives no indication of being aware that any
material change had taken place in the laws of succession at Sparta:
this is one circumstance, for which both Manso and Müller, who both
believe in the extraordinary revolution caused by the permissive law
of the ephor Epitadeus, censure him.</p>

<p>Three other positions are laid down by Manso about the laws of
property at Sparta. 1. A man might give away or bequeathe his land
to whomsoever he pleased. 2. But none except childless persons could
do this. 3. They could only give or bequeathe it to citizens who
had no land of their own. Of these three regulations, the first is
distinctly affirmed by Aristotle, and may be relied upon: the second
is a restriction not noticed by Aristotle, and supported by no proof
except that which arises out of the story of the ephor Epitadeus, who
is said to have been unable to disinherit his son without causing a
new law to be passed: the third is a pure fancy.</p>

<p>So much for the positive evidence, on the faith of which Manso and
Müller affirm the startling fact, that the lots of land in Sparta
remained distinct, indivisible, and unchanged in number, down to the
close of the Peloponnesian war. I venture to say that such positive
evidence is far too weak to sustain an affirmation in itself so
improbable, even if there were no evidence on the other side for
contradiction. But in this case there is powerful contradictory
evidence.</p>

<p>First, the assertions of these authors are distinctly in the teeth
of Aristotle, whose authority they try to invalidate, by saying
that he spoke altogether with reference to his own time at Sparta,
and that he misconceived the primitive Lykurgean constitution. Now
this might form a reasonable ground of presumption against the
competency of Aristotle, if the witnesses produced on the other
side were older than he. But it so happens, that <i>every one</i> of the
witnesses produced by Manso and Müller, are <i>younger</i> than Aristotle:
Herakleidês Ponticus, Plutarch, Justin, Ælian, etc. Nor is it shown
that these authors copied from any source earlier than Aristotle,—for
his testimony cannot be contradicted by any inferences drawn from
Herodotus, Thucydidês, Xenophon, Plato, Isokratês, or Ephorus. None
of these writers, anterior to, or contemporary with, Aristotle,
countenance the fancy of equal, indivisible, perpetual lots, or
prohibition of dowry.</p>

<p>The fact is, that Aristotle is not only our best witness, but also
our oldest witness, respecting the laws of property in the Spartan
commonwealth. I could have wished, indeed, that earlier testimonies
had existed, and I admit that even the most sagacious observer of
340-330 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> is liable to mistake when he speaks of
one or two centuries before. But if Aristotle is to be discredited on
the ground of late date, what are we to say to Plutarch? To insist
on the intellectual eminence of Aristotle would be superfluous:
and on this subject he is a witness the more valuable, as he had
made careful, laborious, and personal inquiries into the Grecian
governments generally, and that of Sparta among them,—the great
<i>point de mire</i> for ancient speculative politicians.</p>

<p>Now the statements of Aristotle, distinctly exclude the idea of
equal, indivisible, inalienable, perpetual lots,—and prohibition
of dowry. He particularly notices the habit of giving very large
dowries, and the constant tendency of the lots of land to become
consolidated in fewer and fewer hands. He tells us nothing upon
the subject which is not perfectly consistent, intelligible, and
uncontradicted by any known statements belonging to his own, or to
earlier times. But the reason why men refuse to believe him, and
either set aside or explain away his evidence, is, that they sit
down to the study with their minds full of the division of landed
property ascribed to Lykurgus by Plutarch. I willingly concede that,
on this occasion, we have to choose between Plutarch and Aristotle.
We cannot reconcile them except by arbitrary suppositions, every one
of which breaks up the simplicity, beauty, and symmetry of Plutarch’s
agrarian idea,—and every one of which still leaves the perpetuity of
the original lots unexplained. And I have no hesitation in preferring
the authority of Aristotle (which is in perfect consonance with what
we indirectly gather from other authors, his contemporaries and
predecessors) as a better witness on every ground; rejecting the
statement of Plutarch, and rejecting it altogether, with all its
consequences.</p>

<p>But the authority of Aristotle is not the only argument which may
be urged to refute this supposition that the distinct Spartan lots
remained unaltered in number down to the time of Lysander. For if the
number of distinct lots remained undiminished, the number of citizens
cannot have greatly diminished. Now the conspiracy of Kinadôn falls
during the life of Lysander, within the first ten years after the
close of the Peloponnesian war: and in the account which Xenophon
gives of that conspiracy, the paucity of the number of citizens is
brought out in the clearest and most emphatic manner. And this must
be before the time when the new law of Epitadeus is said to have
passed, at least before that law can have had room to produce any
sensible effects. If, then, the ancient nine thousand lots still
remained all separate, without either consolidation or subdivision,
how are we to account for the small number of citizens at the time of
the conspiracy of Kinadôn?</p>

<p>This examination of the evidence, for the purpose of which I
have been compelled to prolong the present note, shows—1. That the
hypothesis of indivisible, inalienable lots, maintained for a long
period in undiminished number at Sparta, is not only sustained by
the very minimum of affirmative evidence, but is contradicted by
very good negative evidence. 2. That the hypothesis which represents
dowries to daughters as being prohibited by law, is, indeed, affirmed
by Plutarch, Ælian, and Justin, but is contradicted by the better
authority of Aristotle.</p>

<p>The recent edition of Herakleidês Ponticus, published by
Schneidewin, in 1847, since my first edition, presents an amended
text, which completely bears out my interpretation. His text, derived
from a fuller comparison of existing MSS., as well as from better
critical judgment (see his Prolegg. c. iii. p. liv.), stands—Πωλεῖν
δὲ γὴν Λακεδαιμονίοις αἰσχρὸν νενόμισται· τῆς δὲ ἀρχαίας μοίρας οὐδὲ
ἔξεστιν (p. 7). It is plain that all this passage relates to sale of
land, and not to testation, or succession, or division. Thus much
<i>negatively</i> is certain, and Schneidewin remarks in his note (p.
53) that it contradicts Müller, Hermann, and Schömann,—adding, that
the distinction drawn is, between land inherited from the original
family lots, and land otherwise acquired, by donation, bequest, etc.
Sale of the former was absolutely illegal: sale of the latter was
discreditable, yet not absolutely illegal. Aristotle in the Politics
(ii. 6, 10) takes no notice of any such distinction, between land
inherited from the primitive lots, and land otherwise acquired.
Nor was there, perhaps, any well-defined line of distinction, in a
country of unwritten customs, like Sparta, between what was simply
disgraceful and what was positively illegal. Schneidewin, in his
note, however, assumes the original equality of the lots as certain
in itself, and as being the cause of the prohibition: neither of
which appears to me true.</p>

<p>I speak of this confused compilation still under the name
of Herakleidês Ponticus, by which it is commonly known: though
Schneidewin, in the second chapter of his Prolegomena, has shown
sufficient reason for believing that there is no authority for
connecting it with the name of Herakleidês. He tries to establish the
work as consisting of Excerpta from the lost treatise of Aristotle’s
περὶ Πολιτειῶν: which is well made out with regard to some parts, but
not enough to justify his inference as to the whole. The article,
wherein Welcker vindicates the ascribing of the work to an Excerptor
of Herakleidês, is unsatisfactory (Kleine Schriften, p. 451).</p>

<p>Beyond this irrelevant passage of Herakleidês Ponticus, no farther
evidence is produced by Müller and Manso to justify their positive
assertion, that the Spartan lot of land was indivisible in respect to
inheritance.</p>

<p id="Footnote_713"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_713">[713]</a></span> Herod. vi. 57, in enumerating
the privileges and perquisites of the kings—δικάζειν δὲ μούνους τοὺς
βασιλῆας τόσαδε μοῦνα· πατρούχου τε παρθένου πέρι, ἐς τὸν ἱκνέεται
ἔχειν, ἢν μή περ ὁ πατὴρ αὐτὴν ἐγγυήσῃ· καὶ ὁδῶν δημοσιέων πέρι· καὶ
ἤν τις θετὸν παῖδα ποιέεσθαι ἐθέλῃ, βασιλήων ἐνάντιον ποιέεσθαι.</p>

<p>It seems curious that πατρούχος πάρθενος should mean a damsel who
has <i>no father</i> (literally, <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>): but I suppose
that we must accept this upon the authority of Julius Pollux and
Timæus. Proceeding on this interpretation, Valckenaer gives the
meaning of the passage very justly: “Orbæ nuptias, necdum a patre
desponsatæ, si plures sibi vindicarent, fieretque ἡ ἐπίκληρος, ut
Athenis loquebantur, ἐπίδικος, Spartæ lis ista dirimebatur a regibus
solis.”</p>

<p>Now the judicial function here described, is something very
different from the language of Dr. Thirlwall, that “the kings had the
disposal of the hand of orphan heiresses in cases where the father
had not signified his will.” Such disposal would approach somewhat to
that omnipotence which Aristophanês (Vesp. 585) makes old Philokleon
claim for the Athenian dikasts (an exaggeration well calculated to
serve the poet’s purpose of making the dikasts appear monsters of
caprice and injustice), and would be analogous to the power which
English kings enjoyed three centuries ago as feudal guardians over
wards. But the language of Herodotus is inconsistent with the idea
that the kings <i>chose</i> a husband for the orphan heiress. She was
claimed, as of right, by persons in certain degrees of relationship
to her. Whether the law about ἀγχίστεια, affinity carrying legal
rights, was the same as at Athens, we cannot tell; but the question
submitted for adjudication at Sparta, to the kings, and at Athens
to the dikasteries, was certainly the same, agreeably to the above
note of Valckenaer,—namely, to whom, among the various claimants for
the marriage, the best legal title really belonged. It is, indeed,
probable enough, that the two royal descendants of Hêraklês might
abuse their judicial function, as there are various instances known
in which they take bribes; but they were not likely to abuse it in
favor of an unprovided youth.</p>

<p>Next, as to adoption: Herodotus tells us that the ceremony of
adoption was performed before the kings: probably enough, there was
some fee paid with it. But this affords no ground for presuming
that they had any hand in determining <i>whom</i> the childless father
was to adopt. According to the Attic law about adoption, there were
conditions to be fulfilled, consents to be obtained, the absence of
disqualifying circumstances verified, etc; and some authority before
which this was to be done was indispensable (see Meier und Schömann,
Attisch. Prozess, b. iii. ch. ii. p. 436). At Sparta, such authority
was vested by ancient custom in the king: but we are not told, nor is
it probable, “that he could interpose, in opposition to the wishes of
individuals, to relieve poverty,” as Dr. Thirlwall supposes.</p>

<p>Construing the word πόλεις extensively, so as to include townships
small as well as considerable, this estimate is probably inferior to
the truth; since, even during the depressed times of modern Greece,
a fraction of the ancient Laconia (including in that term Messenia)
exhibited much more than one hundred <i>bourgs</i>.</p>

<p>In reference merely to the territory called La Magne, between
Calamata in the Messenian gulf and Capo di Magna, the lower part of
the peninsula of Tænarus, see a curious letter, addressed to the Duc
de Nevers, in 1618, (on occasion of a projected movement to liberate
the Morea from the Turks, and to insure to him the sovereignty of
it, as descendant of the Palæologi,) by a confidential agent whom he
despatched thither,—M. Chateaurenaud,—who sends to him “une sorte
de tableau statistique du Magne, ou sont énumerés 125 bourgs ou
villages renfermans 4,913 feux, et pouvans fournir 10,000 combattans,
dont 4,000 armés, et 6,000 sans armes (between Calamata and Capo di
Magna).” (Mémoires de l’Académie des Inscriptions, tom. xv. 1842, p.
329. Mémoire de M. Berger Xivrey.)</p>

<p>This estimate is not far removed from that of Colonel Leake,
towards the beginning of the present century, who considers that
there were then in Mani (the same territory) one hundred and thirty
towns and villages; and this too in a state of society exceedingly
disturbed and insecure,—where private feuds and private towers, or
pyrghi, for defence, were universal, and in parts of which, Colonel
Leake says, “I see men preparing the ground for cotton, with a dagger
and pistols at their girdles. This, it seems, is the ordinary armor
of the cultivator when there is no particular suspicion of danger:
the shepherd is almost always armed with a musket.” ... “The Maniotes
reckon their population at thirty thousand, and their muskets at
ten thousand.” (Leake, Travels in Morea, vol. i. ch. vii. pp. 243,
263-266.)</p>

<p>Now, under the dominion of Sparta, all Laconia doubtless enjoyed
complete internal security, so that the idea of the cultivator
tilling his land in arms would be unheard of. Reasoning upon the
basis of what has just been stated about the Maniote population and
number of townships, one hundred πόλεις, for all Laconia, is a very
moderate computation.</p>

(Prot. p. 36) places him in the <i>first</i>, the same as Myrôn, by
mentioning him as having killed Theopompus.</p>

far when he affirms that the statement of Myrôn was “in the teeth of
all tradition.” Müller states incorrectly the citation from Plutarch,
Agis, c. 21 (see his Note <i>h</i>). Plutarch there says nothing about
<i>Tyrtæus</i>: he says that the Messenians affirmed that their hero
Aristomenês had <i>killed</i> the Spartan king Theopompus, whereas the
Lacedæmonians said, that he had only <i>wounded</i> the king. According to
<i>both</i> accounts, then, it would appear that Aristomenês belonged to
the <i>first</i> Messenian war, <i>not to the second</i>.</p>

But Tyrtæus ought not to be understood to affirm distinctly (as
Pausanias, Mr. Clinton, and Müller, all think) that Theopompus
survived and put a close to the war: his language might consist with
the supposition that Theopompus had been slain in the war,—Ὃν δία
(Theopompus), Μεσσήνην εἴλομεν εὐρύχορον.</p>

<p>For we surely might be authorized in saying—“It was through
Epameinondas that the Spartans were conquered and humbled; or it was
through Lord Nelson that the French fleet was destroyed in the last
war,” though both of them perished in the accomplishment.</p>

<p>Tyrtæus, therefore, does not contradict the assertion, that
Theopompus was slain by Aristomenês, nor can he be cited as a witness
to prove that Aristomenês did not live during the <i>first</i> Messenian
war; which is the purpose for which Pausanias quotes him (iv. 6).</p>

a similar account of the sacrilege and murderous conduct of the
Messenian youth at the temple of Artemis Limnatis. His version,
substantially agreeing with that of the Lacedæmonians, seems to be
borrowed from Antiochus, the contemporary of Thucydidês, and is
therefore earlier than the foundation of Messênê by Epameinondas,
from which event the philo-Messenian statements take their rise.
Antiochus, writing during the plenitude of Lacedæmonian power, would
naturally look upon the Messenians as irretrievably prostrate, and
the impiety here narrated would in his mind be the natural cause why
the divine judgments overtook them. Ephorus gives a similar account
(ap. Strabo. vi. p. 280).</p>

<p>The possession of this temple of Artemis Limnatis,—and of the Ager
Dentheliates, the district in which it was situated,—was a subject
of constant dispute between the Lacedæmonians and Messenians after
the foundation of the city of Messênê, even down to the time of the
Roman emperor Tiberius (Tacit. Annal. iv. 43). See Stephan. Byz. v.

<p>From the situation of the temple of Artemis Limnatis, and the

inscriptions, dating from the time of the early Roman emperors,
marking the confines of Lacedæmon and Messênê; both on the line of
the highest ridge of Taygetus, where the waters separate east and
west, and considerably to the eastward of the temple of Artemis
Limnatis, so that at that time the Ager Dentheliates was considered a
part of Messenia.</p>

<p>I now find that Colonel Leake (Peloponnesiaca, p. 181) regards
these Inscriptions, discovered by Professor Ross, as not proving that
the temple of Artemis Limnatis was situated near the spot where they
were found. His authority weighs much with me on such a point, though

<p>Perhaps Leotychides was king during the last revolt of the Helots,
or Messenians, in 464 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, which is called the third
Messenian war. He seems to have been then in exile, in consequence
of his venality during the Thessalian expedition,—but not yet dead
(Herodot. vi. 72). Of the reality of what Mr. Clinton calls the
<i>third</i> Messenian war, in 490 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, I see no adequate
proof (see Fast. Hell. vol. i. p. 257).</p>

<p>The poem of Rhianus was entitled Μεσσηνιακά. He also composed
Θεσσαλικὰ, Ἠλιακὰ, Ἀχαϊκά. See the Fragments,—they are very few,—in
Düntzer’s Collection, pp. 67-77.</p>

<p>He seems to have mentioned Nikoteleia, the mother of Aristomenês
(Fr. ii. p. 73): compare Pausan. iv. 14, 5.</p>

<p>I may remark, that Pausanias, throughout his account of the second
Messenian war, names king Anaxander as leading the Lacedæmonian
troops; but he has no authority for so doing, as we see by iv. 15,
1. It is a pure calculation of his own, from the πατέρων πατέρες of
Tyrtæus.</p>

<p id="Footnote_752"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_752">[752]</a></span> Respecting the position of
the Eleians and Pisatæ during the second Messenian war, there
is confusion in the different statements: as they cannot all be
reconciled, we are compelled to make a choice.</p>

<p>That the Eleians were allies of Sparta, and the Pisatans of
Messenia, and that the contests of Sparta and Messenia were mixed
up with those of Elis and Pisa about the agonothesia of the Olympic
games, is conformable to one distinct statement of Strabo (viii.
pp. 355, 358), and to the passage in Phavorinus v. Αὐγείας, and
is, moreover, indirectly sustained by the view given in Pausanias
respecting the relations between Elis and Pisa (vi. 22, 2), whereby
it clearly appears that the agonothesia was a matter of standing
dispute between the two, until the Pisatans were finally crushed
by the Eleians in the time of Pyrrhus, son of Pantaleôn. Farther,
this same view is really conformable to another passage in Strabo,
which, as now printed, appears to contradict it, but which is
recognized by Müller and others as needing correction, though the
correction which they propose seems to me not the best. The passage
(viii. p. 362) stands thus: Πλεονάκις δ᾽ ἐπολέμησαν (Messenians
and Lacedæmonians) διὰ τὰς ἀποστάσεις τῶν Μεσσηνίων. Τὴν μὲν οὖν
πρώτην κατάκτησιν αὐτῶν φησὶ Τυρταῖος ἐν τοῖς ποιήμασι κατὰ τοὺς
τῶν πατέρων πατέρας γενέσθαι· τὴν δὲ δευτέραν, καθ᾽ ἣν ἑλόμενοι
συμμάχους <em class="gesperrt">Ἠλείους</em> καὶ Ἀργείους καὶ Πισατὰς
ἀπέστησαν, Ἀρκάδων μὲν Ἀριστοκράτην τὸν Ὀρχομένου βασιλάα παρεχομένων
στρατηγὸν, Πισατῶν δὲ Πανταλεόντα τὸν Ὀμφαλίωνος· ἡνίκα φησὶν αὐτὸς
στρατηγῆσαι τὸν πόλεμον τοῖς Λακεδαιμονίοις, etc. Here it is obvious
that, in the enumeration of allies, the Arcadians ought to have been
included; accordingly, both O. Müller and Mr. Clinton (ad annum
672 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) agree in altering the passage thus: they
insert the words <em class="gesperrt">καὶ Ἄρκαδας</em> after the
word <em class="gesperrt">Ἠλείους</em>, so that <i>both Eleians and
Pisatans</i> appear as allies of Messenia at once. I submit that this
is improbable in itself, and inconsistent with the passage of Strabo
previously noticed: the proper way of altering the passage is, in my
judgment, to substitute the word <em class="gesperrt">Ἄρκαδας</em> in
<i>place</i> of the word <em class="gesperrt">Ἠλείους</em>, which makes
the two passages of Strabo consistent with each other, and hardly
does greater violence to the text.</p>

<p>As opposed to the view here adopted, there is, undoubtedly,
the passage of Pausanias (iv. 15, 4) which numbers the Eleians
among the allies of Messenia, and takes no notice of the Pisatæ.
The affirmation of Julius Africanus (ap. Eusebium Chronic. i. p.
145, that the Pisatæ revolted from Elis in the 30th Olympiad, and
celebrated the Olympic games themselves until Ol. 52, for twenty-two
successive ceremonies) is in contradiction,—first, with Pausanias
(vi. 22, 2), which appears to me a clear and valuable statement, from
its particular reference to the <i>three</i> non-Olympiads,—secondly, with
Pausanias (v. 9, 4), when the Eleians in the 50th Olympiad determine
the number of Hellanodikæ. I agree with Corsini (Fasti Attici, t.
iii. p. 47) in setting aside the passage of Julius Africanus: Mr.
Clinton (F. H. p. 253) is displeased with Corsini for this suspicion,
but he himself virtually does the same thing; for, in order to
reconcile Jul. Africanus with Pansanias, he introduces a supposition
quite different from what is asserted by either of them; <i>i. e.</i> a
joint agonothesia by Eleians and Pisatans together. This hypothesis
of Mr. Clinton appears to me gratuitous and inadmissible: Africanus
himself meant to state something quite different, and I imagine him
to have been misled by an erroneous authority. See Mr. Clinton, F. H.
ad. ann. 660 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> to 580 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

<p>The date of the second Messenian war, and the interval between
the second and the first, are points respecting which also there
is irreconcilable discrepancy of statement; we can only choose
the most probable: see the passages collected and canvassed in O.
Müller (Dorians, i. 7, 11, and in Mr. Clinton, Fast. Hellen. vol. i.
Appendix 2, p. 257).</p>

<p>According to Pausanias, the second war lasted from
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 685-668, and there was an interval between
the first and the second war of thirty-nine years. Justin (iii. 5)
reckons an interval of eighty years; Eusebius, an interval of ninety
years. The main evidence is the passage of Tyrtæus, wherein that
poet, speaking during the second war, says, “The fathers of our
fathers conquered Messênê.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clinton adheres very nearly to the view of Pausanias; he
supposes that the real date is only six years lower (679-662). But
I agree with Clavier (Histoire des Premiers Temps de la Grèce, t.
ii. p. 233) and O. Müller (<i>l. c.</i>) in thinking that an interval
of thirty-nine years is too short to suit the phrase of <i>fathers’
fathers</i>. Speaking in the present year (1846), it would not be held
proper to say, “The fathers of our fathers carried on the war between
1793 and the peace of Amiens:” we should rather say, “The fathers of
our fathers carried on the American war and the Seven Years’ war.”
An age is <i>marked</i> by its mature and even elderly members,—by those
between thirty-five and fifty-five years of age.</p>

<p>Agreeing as I do here with O. Müller, against Mr. Clinton, I also
agree with him in thinking that the best mark which we possess of
the date of the second Messenian war is the statement respecting
Pantaleôn: the 34th Olympiad, which Pantaleôn celebrated, probably
fell within the time of the war; which would thus be brought down
much later than the time assigned by Pausanias, yet not so far
down as that named by Eusebius and Justin: the exact year of its
commencement, however, we have no means of fixing.</p>

<p>Krebs, in his discussions on the Fragments of the lost Books of
Diodorus, thinks that that historian placed the beginning of the
second Messenian war in the 35th Olympiad (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 640)
(Krebs, Lectiones Diodoreæ, pp. 254-260).</p>

Both Mantineia and Orchomenus had originally occupied very lofty
hill-sites, and had been rebuilt on a larger scale, lower down,
nearer to the plain (Pausan. viii. 8, 3; 12, 4; 13, 2).</p>

<p>In regard to the relations, during the early historical period,
between Sparta, Argos, and Arcadia, there is a new fragment of
Diodorus (among those recently published by Didot out of the Excerpta
in the Escurial library, Fragment. Historic. Græcor. vol. ii. p.
viii.). The Argeians had espoused the cause of the Arcadians against
Sparta; and at the expense of considerable loss and suffering, had
regained such portions of Arcadia as she had conquered. The king
of Argos restored this recovered territory to the Arcadians: but
the Argeians generally were angry that he did not retain it and
distribute it among them as a reward for their losses in the contest.
They rose in insurrection against the king, who was forced to flee,
and take refuge at Tegea.</p>

of contemptuous sneering, proceeding from Xenophon’s miso-Theban
tendencies: “The Arcadian hoplites, with their clubs, put themselves
forward to be as good as the Thebans.” That these tendencies of
Xenophon show themselves in expressions very unbecoming to the
dignity of history (though curious as evidences of the time), may
be seen by vii. 5, 12, where he says of the Thebans,—ἐνταῦθα δὴ

<p>The readiness with which Karyæ and the Maleates revolted against
Sparta after the battle of Leuktra, even before the invasion of
Laconia by the Thebans, exhibits them apparently as conquered foreign
dependencies of Sparta, without any kindred of race (Xenoph. Hellen.
vi. 5, 24-26; vii. 1, 28). Leuktron, in the Maleatis, seems to
have formed a part of the territory of Megalopolis in the days of
Kleomenês the Third (Plutarch, Kleomenês, 6); in the Peloponnesian
war it was the frontier town of Sparta towards Mount Lykæum (Thuc. v.
53).</p>

<p>“It is to the strength of the frontiers, and the comparatively
large extent of country inclosed within them, that we must trace
the primary cause of the Lacedæmonian power. These enabled the
people, when strengthened by a rigid military discipline, and put in
motion by an ambitious spirit, first to triumph over their weaker
neighbors of Messenia, by this additional strength to overawe the
disunited republics of Arcadia, and at length for centuries to hold
an acknowledged military superiority over every other state in
Greece.</p>

<p>“It is remarkable that all the principal passes into Laconia
lead to one point: this point is Sparta; a fact which shows at
once how well the position of that city was chosen for the defence
of the province, and how well it was adapted, especially as long
as it continued to be unwalled, to maintain a perpetual vigilance
and readiness for defence, which are the surest means of offensive
success.</p>

<p>“The natural openings into the plain of Sparta are only two; one
by the upper Eurotas, as the course of that river above Sparta may be
termed; the other by its only large branch Œnus, now the Kelefina,
which, as I have already stated, joins the Eurotas opposite to the
north-eastern extremity of Sparta. All the natural approaches to
Sparta from the northward lead to one or the other of these two
valleys. On the side of Messenia, the northerly prolongation of Mount
Taygetum, which joins Mount Lyceum at the pass of Andania, now the
pass of Makryplái, furnishes a continued barrier of the loftiest
kind, admitting only of routes easily defensible; and which,—whether
from the Cromitis of Arcadia to the south-westward of the modern
Londári, from the Stenykleric plain, from the plain of the Pamisus,
or from Pheræ, now Kalamáta,—all descend into the valley of the
upper Eurotas, and conduct to Sparta by Pellana. There was, indeed,
a branch of the last-mentioned route, which descended into the
Spartan plain at the modern Mistra, and which must have been a very
frequent communication between Sparta and the lower part of Messenia;
but, like the other direct passes over Taygetum, it was much more
difficult and defensible than those which I have called the natural
entrances of the province.”</p>

τούτῳ μειονεκτεῖν ἡγοῦνται, ἀλλ᾽ ἔστιν ὅτε καὶ πλεονεκτεῖν,—the
ἄρχων was the first enomotarch of the lochus, the πρωτοστάτης (as
appears from 11, 5), when the enômoty marched in single file. To
put the ἡγεμὼν on the right flank, was done <i>occasionally</i> for

δοκῇ ξυμφέρειν, τον ἡγεμόνα <em class="gesperrt">δέξιον</em> κέρας
ἔχειν, etc. I understand Xenophon’s description of the παραγωγὴ,
or deployment, differently from Müller,—it rather seems that the
enômoties which stood first made a side-movement to the left, so that
the first enomotarch still maintained his place on the left, at the
same time that the opportunity was created for the enômoties in the
rear to come up and form equal front, τῷ ἐνωμοτάρχῃ παρεγγυᾶται εἰς
μέτωπον παρ᾽ ἀσπίδα καθίστασθαι,—the words <em class="gesperrt">παρ᾽

the left-hand, as it is shown by the words which follow,—καὶ <em
class="gesperrt">διὰ παντὸς οὖτος</em> ἔστ᾽ ἂν ἡ φάλαγξ ἐναντία

It is to be recollected, however, that the practice of the Cyreian
troops cannot be safely quoted as authority for the practice at
Sparta. Xenophon and his colleagues established lochi, pentekosties,
and enômoties in the Cyreian army: the lochus consisted of one
hundred men, but the numbers of the other two divisions are not

Rachetti (Della Milizia dei Grechi Antichi, Milan, 1807, p. 166)
all think that lochus and mora were different names for the same
division; but if this is to be reconciled with the statement of
Xenophon in Repub. Lac. c. 11, we must suppose an actual change of
nomenclature after the Peloponnesian war, which appears to be Dr.
Arnold’s opinion,—yet it is not easy to account for.</p>

<p>There is one point in Dr. Thirlwall’s Appendix which is of some
importance, and in which I cannot but dissent from his opinion.
He says, after stating the nomenclature and classification of the
Spartan military force as given by Xenophon, “Xenophon speaks only of
Spartans, as appears by the epithet πολιτικῶν,” p. 521: the words of
Xenophon are, Ἑκάστη δὲ τῶν πολιτικῶν μορῶν ἔχει πολέμαρχον ἕνα, etc.
(Rep. Lac. 11.)</p>

<p>It appears to me that Xenophon is here speaking of the aggregate
Lacedæmonian heavy-armed force, including both Spartans and
Periœki,—not of Spartans alone. The word πολιτικῶν does not mean
Spartans as distinguished from Periœki, but Lacedæmonians as
distinguished from allies. Thus, when Agesilaus returns home from
the blockade of Phlius, Xenophon tells us that ταῦτα ποιήσας τοὺς
μὲν συμμάχους ἀφῆκε, τὸ δὲ πολιτικὸν οἴκαδε ἀπήγαγε (Hellen. v. 3,
25).</p>

<p>O. Müller, also, thinks that the whole number of five thousand
seven hundred and forty men, who fought at the first battle of
Mantineia, in the thirteenth year of the Peloponnesian war, were
furnished by the city of Sparta itself (Hist. of Dorians, iii. 12,
2): and to prove this, he refers to the very passage just cited from
the Hellenica of Xenophon, which, as far as it proves anything,
proves the contrary of his position. He gives no other evidence
to support it, and I think it in the highest degree improbable. I
have already remarked that he understands the expression πολιτικὴ
χώρα (in Polybius, vi. 45) to mean the district of Sparta itself as
contradistinguished from Laconia,—a construction which seems to me
not warranted by the passage in Polybius.</p>

Etymologic. Mag. Μόρα. The statement of Aristotle is transmitted so
imperfectly that we cannot make out clearly what it was. Xenophon
says that there were six moræ in all, comprehending all the citizens
of military age (Rep. Lac. 11, 3). But Ephorus stated the mora at
five hundred men, Kallisthenes at seven hundred, and Polybius at nine
hundred (Plutarch, Pelopid. 17; Diodor. xv. 32). If all the citizens
competent to bear arms were comprised in six moræ, the numbers of
each mora must of course have varied. At the battle of Mantineia,
there were seven Lacedæmonian lochi, each lochus containing four
pentekosties, and each pentekosty containing four enômoties:
Thucydidês seems, as I before remarked, to make each enômoty
thirty-two men. But Xenophon tells us that each mora had four lochi,
each lochus two pentekosties, and each pentekosty two enômoties (Rep.
Lac. 11, 4). The names of these divisions remained the same, but the
numbers varied.</p>

<p>At Argos, there was a body of one thousand hoplites, who, during
the Peloponnesian war, received training in military manœuvres at the
cost of the city (Thucyd. v. 67), but there is reason to believe that
this arrangement was not introduced until about the period of the
peace of Nikias in the tenth or eleventh year of the Peloponnesian
war, when the truce between Argos and Sparta was just expiring, and
when the former began to entertain schemes of ambition. The Epariti
in Arcadia began at a much later time, after the battle of Leuktra
(Xenoph. Hellen. vii. 4, 33).</p>

by Plutarch as luxurious and effeminate (De capiendâ ab hostibus

<p>O. Müller (Hist. of Dorians, iii. 6, 10) identifies Lakidês, son
of Meltas, named by Pausanias, with Leôkêdês son of Pheidôn, named by
Herodotus as one of the suitors for the daughter of Kleisthenês the
Sikyonian (vi. 127); and he thus infers that Meltas must have been
deposed and succeeded by Ægon, about 560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> This

<p>Strabo distinguishes two places called Orneæ; one a village in
the Argeian territory, the other a town between Corinth and Sikyôn:
but I doubt whether there ever were two places so called: the town
or village dependent on Argos seems the only place (Strabo. viii. p.
376).</p>

<p>The Kleônæans are also said to have aided the Argeians in the
destruction of Mykenæ, conjointly with the Tegeatans: from hence,
however, we cannot infer anything as to their dependence at that time

<p>The tenth Nemean Ode of Pindar is on this point peculiarly good
evidence, inasmuch as it is composed for, and supposed to be sung
by Theiæus, a native of Argos. Had there been any jealousy then
subsisting between Argos and Kleônæ on the subject of the presidency
of this festival, Pindar would never, on such an occasion, have
mentioned expressly the Kleônæans as presidents.</p>

<p>The statements of the Scholia on Pindar, that the Corinthians
at one time celebrated the Nemean games, or that they were of old
celebrated at Sikyôn, seem unfounded (Schol. Pind. Arg. Nem., and
Nem. x. 49).</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
